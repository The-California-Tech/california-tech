    The CGPU-UAW Bargaining Team is a group of eleven Graduate Student Workers and five Postdocs democratically elected to represent their peers in collective bargaining with the Caltech administration.

Nearly a year since voting to form our union, the elected CGPU bargaining team is proud to unanimously endorse a YES vote on a full Tentative Agreement (TA) to ratify Caltech Postdoc (PD) and Graduate Student Workers’ (GSWs) first-ever union contract. This historic agreement demonstrates the power GSWs and PDs have built and exercised through mass engagement in our contract campaign. It also reflects a shared desire between GSWs and PDs and the Caltech Administration to reach an agreement in the wake of devastating wildfires and in the face of the threat posed by the Trump administration. Should we ratify this Tentative Agreement, Postdocs and GSWs would have the **strongest protections in academia against the upcoming Trump administration.**

When Trump was in office last, Title IX was significantly weakened, visa renewal processes became increasingly complex, and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) [systematically rolled back](https://www.epi.org/publication/unprecedented-the-trump-nlrbs-attack-on-workers-rights/) workers’ rights to form unions and engage in collective bargaining. Already in the first week in office, [Trump has attacked DEI initiatives and transgender rights](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/trump-immigration-climate-dei-policies.html), raising concerns about the future of discrimination protections. In contrast, this agreement secures enforceable protections against discrimination, harassment, and abuse, with a grievance process independent of Title IX and, if necessary, third party mediation within 90 days–with interim measures guaranteed for survivors to continue research safely. It also enshrines robust provisions for international workers, including two-year minimum initial appointments for PDs, up to 7 days paid time off for visa renewal, and clear rehiring protections for workers who fall out of visa status—all of which are industry-leading. **Our unprecedented article on freedom of speech protects our right to engage in mass, collective action to enforce and even *improve* our contract.** If SpaceX, Amazon, Trader Joe’s, Starbucks, and the USC administration win their [cases](https://www.epi.org/blog/whats-behind-the-corporate-effort-to-kneecap-the-national-labor-relations-board-spacex-amazon-trader-joes-and-starbucks-are-trying-to-have-the-nlrb-declared-unconstitutional/) against the NLRB, deeming it unconstitutional, this contract is the best defense we will have.

Together, we won a cumulative raise of 25% ($9,744) for GSWs and 13% ($8,243) for PDs between Fall 2022, when the unionization campaign launched amidst the historic strike in the UC system, and Fall 2025. Going forward, this Agreement guarantees wage increases to at least $48,244 in Fall 2025 and $50,000 in Fall 2026 for GSWs and $72,723 in Fall 2025 and $75,268 in Fall 2026 for PDs, and a 2% wage increase for PDs already paid above the minimum. It will also provide an $800 ratification bonus for all GSWs and PDs by May 15, significantly reduced healthcare premiums for GSWs (saving $442/year for individuals and $794/year per dependent at the current rates), $500 in visa renewal reimbursement for international workers, and the creation of an entirely new hardship fund with at least $125,000 to support postdoc parents financially.

Collective bargaining is about identifying compromises that both the researchers and the Institute are willing to make to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. As the bargaining team, we know that the financial gains made in this Agreement are not enough to meet the needs of all GSWs and PDs, particularly for parents relying on single incomes. However, we believe that this first contract forms a strong foundation on which future negotiations can build. 

Beyond the contract, our union provides the means for GSWs and PDs to come together to support each other and push for positive change with a united voice. As the movement to unionize research institutions in and beyond academia continues to grow, each campus's improvements benefit us all in our shared goal of an equitable and sustainable workplace. In two years, when PDs and GSWs begin our next contract fight, we will have the advantage of the strength of our first contract and the progress made by other academic unions to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our community further. We look forward to PDs and GSWs continuing the collective effort to improve the lives and experiences of those of us here and build a Caltech for everyone.

A full summary of the Tentative Agreement (and the complete text of the Agreement) detailing the wins above and additional provisions can be found at [caltechgpu.org/ratification](https://caltechgpu.org/ratification/). **GSWs and PDs can vote online in the ratification vote on Tuesday Jan 28 and Wednesday January 29.**
