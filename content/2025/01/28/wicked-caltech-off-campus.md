If you've recently heard students humming show tunes, hyping up hockey games, or debating the best rides at Knott's Berry Farm, you've probably stumbled upon the buzz surrounding Caltech's Off-Campus Programming Series. What started as a pilot program to foster student engagement is now a fully-fledged initiative under the *Office of Student and Family Engagement* (SFE).

I recently had the chance to chat with Steven Metzmaker, Assistant Director of Residential & Student Experience, who has been orchestrating these off-campus escapades. From musicals to sports games, Steven and his team are redefining what taking a break from problem sets and lab work means. Here's how they're making magic happen (and yes, it includes a trip to *Wicked*).

**How do you get the money for all this? Are these events funded by donations?**

Great question! As it turns out, the funding doesn't just fall from the sky (or magically appear like a Broadway spotlight). Steven shared that the SFE team wrote a grant to secure the financing of these events after conducting a needs assessment based on student input, the C3 report, and anecdotal evidence.

"We wanted to make sure the programs address real student needs," Steven explained. "By listening to what students want, we've been able to create events that are meaningful, fun, and engaging."

**Which activities do you think are the most valuable for students?**

Without hesitation, Steven emphasized that *any* off-campus activity holds immense value for students. "We work hard to cater to a variety of interests and explore an array of attractions," he said.

For the 2023–2024 academic year, students enjoyed outings like the *Hadestown* musical, LAFC soccer games, and even a trip to Knott's Berry Farm. As for 2024–2025, the lineup was and will be just as exciting:

- Pasadena Art Night
- LA Rams football game
- LA Kings hockey game
- Knott's Berry Farm (with ASCIT!)
- *Wicked* Musical

Whether it's cheering on the local team or diving into the arts, these experiences give students a chance to bond, recharge, and explore the world outside of campus.

**Have you thought about inviting Caltech faculty or staff to join these trips?**

The answer is a big YES! Steven shared that he’s already invited folks from Caltech’s Student Affairs and is eager to involve more faculty and staff in future outings.

“I would hope to have trips led by a faculty member or staff member who has a unique background related to the destination,” Steven said. “This would give students a chance to connect with the Caltech community in a new way.”

The idea of having a professor lead a trip to, say, the Getty Center or the Huntington Library sounds like the perfect way to combine education with exploration. And as for famous people? Well, who knows? Maybe Steven has a few surprises up his sleeve. Although I have asked him way too many times to take us to see a game of the Lakers and Lebron, but there is no way!

**What about grants for clubs? How can they connect with the SFE?**

Steven was excited to highlight the new grants available for student clubs, which are detailed on the SFE website’s [Extra Funding page](https://sfe.caltech.edu/student-financial-hub/extra-funding).

From the Huang “Fun Fund” to the Moore-Hufstedler Fund and the George W. Housner Student Discovery Fund, there are plenty of opportunities for clubs to secure funding for creative and meaningful activities.

“These grants could definitely tie into the Off-Campus Programming Series,” Steven noted. “For example, a club could apply for funding to organize a retreat or competition, and we could collaborate to make it part of the broader student experience.”

**A Personal Note: Why These Trips Matter**

When I asked Steven what drives him to organize these events, it was clear that he’s passionate about creating opportunities for students to unwind and connect.

“It’s amazing to see students step away from their intense schedules and just have fun,” Steven said. “Whether it’s a musical, a hockey game, or a trip to Knott’s Berry Farm, these moments remind us that there’s more to the Caltech experience than labs and lectures.”

**What Students Are Saying**

Of course, it wouldn’t be a proper article without hearing from the students themselves. Here are just a few testimonials from those who’ve participated in the Off-Campus Programming Series:

- “*Hadestown* was so incredible—with all the build-up and light work, and the unavoidability of the tragedy, I left the theater in a daze. That’s the catharsis of Greek theater for you.” – Albert Y. Huang
- “I loved this event \[*Hadestown*\]! I’m so glad Caltech sponsored a completely free trip for us because I never would have seen this musical otherwise, and it has changed my brain chemistry a little.” – Ling-Yi Wu
- “LA is such a hub of art and culture. Unfortunately, as an international student without a car, it can be hard to get all the way down to LA. I loved the opportunity to check out this phenomenal musical!” – Tanmay Gupta

From *Wicked* to wickedly fun soccer matches, the Off-Campus Programming Series is proving to be a game-changer for Caltech students. Thanks to Steven and the SFE team, students now have more opportunities than ever to explore, connect, and recharge. So, what’s next? Only time will tell—but if the past is any indication, the future of Caltech’s off-campus programming is bright (and maybe even Broadway-level dazzling).

Stay tuned, and don’t forget to sign up for the next adventure!
