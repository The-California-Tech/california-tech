*This interview was conducted two weeks before the wildfire that devastated Los Angeles. Nothing underscores the urgency of addressing climate change more than moments like these.*

Sandy Krasner has dedicated over 45 years to his work as a System Engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). He is also the leader of the Pasadena-Foothills chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), an international nonprofit organization advocating for national and global climate action, and a Pasadena 100 climate coalition member.

**With over 45 years at JPL, what inspired you to become a leader in climate advocacy alongside your engineering career?**

Sandy Krasner reflected on his dual passions for technical problem-solving and addressing global challenges, saying:

“It’s really two things for me. First, climate change is a massive problem—arguably the biggest one we’re facing today. It’s deeply connected to so many other global crises, like droughts, floods, wildfires, and the displacement of populations due to climate disruptions. These ripple effects lead to social upheaval, economic instability, and even revolutions. Tackling this issue is absolutely critical.”

He continued, “The second reason is that climate change has a significant technical dimension. Addressing it requires not only understanding the science but also the technical aspects of the solutions we’re developing. With my engineering background, I can make a meaningful contribution in this area. Unlike social justice or other fields where I lack specific expertise, climate advocacy allows me to apply my skills in a practical and impactful way.”

At JPL, Krasner’s role as an end-to-end information systems engineer has equipped him with a unique perspective on complex systems. “I’m responsible for ensuring that all the different computer systems involved in a flight project work seamlessly together—from the instruments on the spacecraft to the ground control systems and ultimately to the science center. It’s a mix of data formats, protocols, and strategic coordination. My job is to make sure everything fits together and functions as a cohesive system,” he explained.

This ability to manage complex systems, collaborate across diverse teams, and navigate technical challenges translates seamlessly into his climate advocacy work. “It’s all about coordination and ensuring we’re all working toward the same story—whether it’s building a spacecraft or addressing the climate crisis,” Krasner noted.

**How does the Citizens’ Climate Lobby plan to navigate and push forward its agenda amidst the policies of the Trump administration?**						

“For background, the Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) focuses on lobbying congressional representatives to support legislation addressing climate change. That’s why it’s called the Citizens’ Climate Lobby—it’s about empowering citizens to engage with their representatives.” CCL is an international organization with chapters in every congressional district in the U.S. Locally, I lead the Pasadena-Foothills chapter, which covers three districts: Judy Chu’s (Pasadena to Claremont), Jimmy Gomez’s (Mid-City LA), and what was Adam Schiff’s district, now represented by Laura Friedman.			

“Our work is guided by the national CCL organization, which identifies legislative priorities. We then meet with representatives to advocate for these policies. Recently, a group within CCL has also started lobbying for California state legislation because there’s much more progress happening at the state level than federally.					

“Over the next two to four years, much of the focus will be on preventing regression in climate policies. With the current federal political climate, it’s going to be a challenge. But we aim to minimize damage and, where possible, push forward progress. As a nonpartisan organization, CCL doesn’t endorse candidates or engage in campaigns. Instead, we focus on bringing Republicans and Democrats together to address climate change.”						

Krasner also highlighted CCL’s long-standing advocacy for carbon pricing: “For years, we’ve promoted a ‘carbon fee and dividend’ approach, which puts a fee on each ton of CO2 emissions. The collected revenue would then be rebated equally to all households. This approach can potentially reduce emissions while being market-driven, appealing to Republicans who favor free-market solutions. However, it’s been challenging to gain bipartisan support recently.”					

He outlined other initiatives CCL is currently pursuing, including:							

●  **Energy Permitting Reform**: Simplifying the process for connecting renewable energy sources like solar and wind to the electrical grid, which is often hampered by regulatory hurdles. \
 													 \
●  **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism**: Imposing tariffs on imported goods based on their carbon footprint is a policy Canada and the European Union adopted. \
 								 \
“A major focus now is protecting the progress made under Biden,” Krasner added, “especially the Inflation Reduction Act, which allocated significant funding for renewable energy, electric vehicles, and battery production. About two-thirds of these funds have been spent in Republican districts, which we hope will create bipartisan incentives to maintain these programs.” \
 								 \
With a pragmatic approach and a commitment to bipartisan solutions, the Citizens’ Climate Lobby is steadfast in its mission to combat climate change despite the challenges ahead. \
 														**What are the most urgent steps the U.S. should take to address climate change, and how can local chapters like yours contribute?**

Sandy Krasner emphasized the critical role of advancing energy infrastructure and legislation, saying:			

“One of the key areas we need to focus on is permitting reform. A lot of renewable energy projects are delayed because of the complexities involved in connecting them to the grid. It’s especially evident here in California, where, during certain times of the day, we’re running almost 100% on renewable energy. That’s an incredible achievement, but the real challenge is storage—ensuring we can capture that energy and use it when it’s needed.”		

He highlighted the importance of battery storage as a transformative solution: “There’s a huge amount of technology being developed in the battery storage space right now, and it’s incredibly promising. The critical next step is passing legislation to support and incentivize these advancements. The technology exists—we just need the right policies to make it accessible and scalable.”						

Krasner explained that local Citizens’ Climate Lobby chapters play a vital role in pushing these legislative efforts forward. “Our job is to advocate for these changes, educate our representatives about the opportunities, and ensure they understand how effective these policies could be. It’s about bridging the gap between what’s technically possible and what’s politically feasible.”

**What role do innovation and technology play in solving the climate crisis, and how does JPL’s work intersect with these solutions?**						

Sandy Krasner reflected on the intersection of innovation and action, emphasizing that while technological advancements are crucial, the tools to address climate change already exist.					

“That’s a really interesting question because innovation and technology are certainly important, but we’re not entirely dependent on new breakthroughs to tackle climate change,” he explained. “There’s a researcher at Stanford, Mark Jacobson, who wrote a book called *No Miracles Needed. *His central point is that we already have the technologies to address the climate crisis—we’re not waiting for some kind of scientific miracle. The tools are here; it’s about implementing them effectively.”

Krasner highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance existing technologies, particularly in energy storage. “There’s a tremendous amount of work happening to make batteries more efficient, and a fair amount of that is being done right here at Caltech. At the same time, we’re collaborating with Professor Steven Low at Caltech to work on grid optimization. Utilities have argued that too much rooftop solar could destabilize the grid, but what we’re finding is that’s not entirely true. There are technologies to address those issues, and we’re working to better understand and implement those solutions.”				

Turning to JPL’s contributions, Krasner described how its cutting-edge space missions provide critical insights into climate change. “At JPL, we’re deploying satellites to monitor carbon dioxide levels, offering granular data on where emissions are coming from. This kind of precision is vital for addressing the problem at its source. We’re also working on atmospheric and climate modeling to refine predictions about what’s coming. While these tools help us understand the scale and urgency of the problem, they reinforce what we already know: climate change is real, and we need to act now.”				

He concluded with a pragmatic outlook: “Innovation and technology will continue to play a role in improving solutions, but we don’t have to wait for the next big invention. The time to act is now, using the resources and knowledge we already have.”

**What motivates you to continue this work after such a long and distinguished career? What advice would you give to young scientists and engineers who want to engage in climate advocacy?**				

Sandy Krasner’s passion for addressing the climate crisis remains unwavering, even after decades of a celebrated career at JPL. “This is a really important problem, and that’s what keeps me motivated,” he said. “I actually hope to dedicate even more of my time to this work. There’s so much happening—so many opportunities to contribute. It could easily become a full-time focus.”

For young scientists and engineers aspiring to make a difference, Krasner offered a dual perspective: leveraging professional expertise and engaging in grassroots efforts. “Professionally, there’s a lot of work being done in areas like battery technology, climate modeling, and renewable energy solutions. These are critical fields for anyone looking to contribute through their careers,” he explained.						

“But beyond your professional work, there’s a lot you can do individually. One of the members of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby board of directors always says the most important thing is to talk to people. Share what’s happening—clarify the problem and help others understand that solutions exist. Yes, it’ll take work, but acting now will be far less costly than dealing with the consequences of inaction. If we stay on the current path, things will only get worse, and the price we’ll pay will be far greater than the investments we need to make today.”						

He emphasized the importance of inspiring action through clear communication. “It’s about helping people see that while the challenges are significant, the solutions are achievable and worth pursuing. Investing now means building a better future—not just for ourselves, but for generations to come.”						

**What message would you like to share with Caltech students and the broader community about their role in combating climate change?**						

Sandy Krasner emphasized both the urgency of climate action and the opportunities available for individuals and communities to make a difference. “The most important thing to understand is that there are solutions, and they’re affordable,” he said. “We need to be able to clearly explain to people—and to our legislators—what steps need to be taken to fight climate change. Progress doesn’t require miracles; it starts with what we already have available.”						

He highlighted the unique position of Caltech students and researchers in advancing these efforts. “Caltech is an incredible place for innovation. Whether it’s working on grid optimization, renewable energy solutions, or other advancements, there’s a lot happening here that can drive meaningful progress. But innovation doesn’t mean we have to wait. We can start taking action right now.”						

Krasner also stressed that everyone, regardless of their expertise, has a role to play. “Each person can contribute. Whether you’re a scientist, an engineer, or just someone concerned about the future, you can make a difference. One of the simplest but most impactful things you can do is contact your legislators—even if you’re not a citizen—and let them know this issue is important. Clear communication and engagement can push policymakers to act.”						

He shared a local example of community-driven change: “I’ve been involved with a group called Pasadena 100, which focuses on getting Pasadena Water and Power to commit to 100% renewable energy by 2030. We successfully got a resolution passed by the city council, and now we’re working closely with the utility to address their concerns and show them that this goal is achievable. This is a hyper-local effort but serves as a model for other cities.”						

Krasner underscored the need for collaboration across all levels: “There’s work to be done at the city, state, and national levels, and there are countless ways to contribute. From hyper-local initiatives like Pasadena 100 to national campaigns, there’s space for everyone to get involved. Pasadena’s efforts, for example, are inspiring other cities and showing what’s possible.”	

In closing, he encouraged students and the broader community to find their niche. “Whatever your interests or skills, there’s an area where you can make an impact. Climate action is happening everywhere, and every contribution matters.”

As the climate crisis continues to escalate, Sandy Krasner's dedication to both engineering excellence and climate advocacy serves as an inspiring example of how individuals can leverage their expertise and passion to address one of humanity’s greatest challenges. Whether through local efforts like Pasadena 100, advancing renewable energy solutions, or advocating for policy change, Krasner underscores that there is a role for everyone in combating climate change.

*This question emerged after devastating wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles County.*				

**How do events like the wildfires influence your climate advocacy efforts, especially in pushing for policy changes? Can the scale of these disasters drive more urgency in legislative action?**			

The Eaton fire has been a catastrophe for the members of our chapter, as well as for many other people. Two of our members have lost their homes, and many have been displaced or had their homes damaged. This is a time to mourn people and to grieve for what we have lost. But it is also a time to redouble the fight against climate change.

These fires are not “business as usual” in California. The climate attribution studies have not yet been completed, but it is clear that climate change made these fires much worse. Climate scientists speak of “climate whiplash”. California went from a wet winter to a record drought. Lush greenery grew in the canyon; then Southern California had the second-driest period in history, with only 0.16 inches of rain falling from May 6 to December 31. The lush greenery dried to kindling. Wind speeds were double the usual Santa Ana. Embers flew up to 4 miles. A catastrophe was inevitable.
