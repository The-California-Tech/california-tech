Experience:

TLDR: Great Seafood restaurant not too far from campus. Go try some lobster!

Located in Chinatown, Full House is twenty minutes from campus by car. Visiting on a Tuesday night, parking was readily available although it could be more scarce on busier nights. From the moment we entered the restaurant the service was exemplary and it was evident the waiters brought their “A game”. A teapot was placed in the center of our table followed by a tiny cup of nuts for each guest. Waiting for our appetizers to arrive, I was amused trying to pick up and eat nuts with chopsticks. Soon, the onslaught started as dish after dish quickly covered our table. I captured a photo of each entree; the Lobster, Oysters, and Duck as they arrived from the kitchen.

Appetizer:

Crab Meat with Fish Maw Soup - If you love seafood this is a real treat to start the evening as an appetizer. I recommend adding a splash of red vinegar to the soup (provided on the table). The red vinegar combined with the soup created an interesting and refreshing blend of flavor unlike anything I have ever tasted before.

Main Courses:

Braised Lobster with Pepper and Black Bean - I always wanted to try lobster and this worthy first time experience definitely did not disappoint. Every part of the lobster had meat inside, although often a challenge, working to find your food made the reward all the more deliciously satisfying. The claw provided the easiest meat to get as it just slid out when you cracked it open. I was delighted that Tom helped me discover hidden lobster meat near the head of the Lobster. The restaurant let me take a photo with the lobster before it was cooked as well.

Peking Roasted Duck - Super unexpected taste overall left me shocked. I had never imagined eating a duck before but after eating it just left me craving for more. In addition to the duck, bao buns and a special sauce were provided. The duck on its own was great, but I had fun making little sandwiches with the buns, duck meat, and the mystery sauce.

Steamed Sole Fish - This fish was an interesting eat, done right the skeleton of the fish will just slide off and provide a great meal. However, it can be a really tricky meal. I found it challenging not to swallow bones and only swallow the fish. Overall, the fish was great and I had a fun time eating it.

Oysters with Ginger & Green Onion - Completely different from regular oysters, I highly recommend trying this dish if you want to experience a very unique flavor that you can’t get from just regular oysters. I was so fascinated by the taste that I looked it up after dinner to see how the dish was made. Frozen oysters are put with green onions and ginger (obviously). However the rest is listed on this website and I recommend anyone who is debating whether to order this to definitely check it out.

Honey Walnut Prawns - This was like a sweet treat completely distinct from every other food offered on the table. It was like eating little shrimps covered in honey, but it reminded me of eating sweet popcorn in the movie theater. Every time you took one prawn you just wanted to take another one, and another one. Eating the walnuts in conjunction with the prawns was great as well, giving another avenue of flavor to experience.

Finale:

The service was amazing. I didn’t have to wait for water once, and the food was spectacular. My favorite food was definitely the Peking Duck but I would for sure have the lobster again if I had the chance. At the end of our meal we all got fortune cookies and oranges calling to a close this wonderful evening. I’d like to provide my email address and phone number below if anyone has any other questions about this restaurant, or has some requests about how I can improve my food reviews.
