  Life. Food. Family. Home. These are what Olive Garden seems to symbolize to the American public. And according to the SNL Olive Garden sketch (sketches? I don't know how many have been made). But if I had to choose one word to describe Olive Garden, it would just be 'big'.

Life. Food. Family. Home. These are what Olive Garden seems to symbolize to the American public. And according to the SNL Olive Garden sketch (sketches? I don't know how many have been made). But if I had to choose one word to describe Olive Garden, it would just be 'big'.


Firstly, it's a big chain. There's multiple outlets across the country (a quick search reveals there's 894 outlets across the country, which is 0.0665277571 times the number of McDonald's in the US, but also 894 times the number of Red Doors in the US). So this firstly makes it big because it's widespread, and also they're all just big actual places. It's also like Cheesecake Factory, another super big thing. And isn't big just another part of the American Dream? So Olive Garden is peak American and also just BigTM.

Secondly, it's also big because all the food there is so big. Like I have never been to an Olive Garden and been able to finish all my food. Not even the food, I've never even gotten close to finishing the water. The glasses are just so big and there's far too much ice ­­- which also melts and then just proceeds to give you more water. And then they say you can get either a salad or soup before you actually eat your meal and those bowls are also biiiig. So you have a pre-meal that's massive, and then you also have a massive actual meal, so by the end of it you're just staggering out of the restaurant barely holding onto your own tummy. So that's properly insane.

Thirdly, I'm not sure what's left to say, and unlike Olive Garden, I will try to keep this article Not Big. But the next time you go to Olive Garden, I hope you think of this article. And then I hope you think 'that's what she said'.
