## _Homosexuals against HOME:_

_Editor’s note: This letter was emailed to the _Tech_’s business address with the subject line “Letter to the editor (okay to publish)” from one [wlela@yahoo.com](mailto:wlela@yahoo.com).

We used to be able to count on younger generations to challenge and question older generations, challenge and question the status quo, the establishment, the powers-that-be.  You might say it was their job, their function.  And that urge to challenge is probably natural.  Just like in the animal kingdom, where younger animals, for example, will challenge older animals to see who gets to lead and reproduce ("survival of the fittest"), so young people are probably naturally driven to challenge older people.

The current younger generation, however, is a disappointment and almost an embarassment _[sic.]_ to previous younger generations.  Instead of challenging the establishment, it is letting the establishment walk all over them, letting the establishment impose its very questionable and arguably corrupt values on them.  The younger generation doesn't seem to be able to see that it's being lied to, misled, manipulated, and indoctrinated by the establishment.

(It should be noted that the current establishment is very left-wing.  Left-wingers dominate the news media, the educational system, the entertainment industry, social media, many government bureaucracies, and even many corporations.)

Perhaps the best example of the Big Lies the left-wing establishment has successfully spread is the "Born That Way" propaganda.  There never was any solid science to back that up.  Nobody has ever found a "gay gene" in humans yet.  Indeed, the latest science basically proved there are NO gay genes in humans.  But so many people have fallen for the specious propaganda that heterophobic homosexuals are born that way.

The younger generation needs to wake up and see what's really happening.  So many of them are being cheated out of a proper education, are being indoctrinated instead of educated.  Sad to say, but they are being played for fools and don't even know it.

Sincerely, Wayne Lela

 

 


## _Serious article:_

It is ironic in a way that Lela is himself telling the younger generation to challenge the older generation as that is, in essence, what is happening here. Lela (a member of the older generation) is telling the younger generation (college campus) how homosexuality is immoral. Should we not then take his advice and challenge this notion? Indeed, support for gay rights has always been more popular with the younger generations than the older ones and many of the pushes for gay rights have come from younger generations.

 

In fact, the Stonewall riots (often cited as a major part of the early gay rights movement) was composed of mainly the younger generation (at the time). If one argues that the legalization of gay marriage (still relatively recent) is part of the establishment and status-quo that needs to be challenged by the younger generation, then surely the foundations of our entire nation ought to be reversed every generation. The continuing obstacles for gay rights are primarily put in place by the older generation and this is what many young gay rights activists fight against.

 

Lela claims that the establishment is indoctrinating the younger generation but quite frankly if that were true then the amount of people who identify as something other than cis-het (straight and cisgender) would be a lot higher than 7.1% (Gallup, 2021). Perhaps Lela believes that gay people existing in public and teaching children it is okay to be gay is indoctrination. However, if this is indoctrination, how would Lela describe the heteronormative sex education that was the norm for many years, and indeed still is the norm in many places (the sex education I received in Indiana was explicitly abstinence only and heteronormative). Teaching children it is okay to be gay is not going to turn straight children gay, but it will help them not live in fear and feel more accepted.

 

Lela claims the latest science supports his claim that there is no gay gene and gay people are not “Born That Way” however neglected to cite any source. In absence of a source to back up this claim, one must conclude the science does not support his claim. A large-scale study from 2019 found a definite link between certain genes and homosexual behavior. While this is not a single “gay gene” that can determine your sexuality, it nonetheless refutes that homosexuality is entirely a choice. And while 2019 is more than 4 years ago, there is no more recent science which refutes it.

[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat7693](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat7693)

 

Interesting to note also is the terminology used here. Lela uses the phrase “heterophobic homosexuals” seemingly to refer to the entire gay population who claims to be “born that way”. However Lela has also stated on the website for his organization (home60515.com):


    **Before we close this section, some words on the mean-spirited use of the term "homophobic" by those who love to call people like this writer pejorative and inflammatory names. Homophobia doesn't really exist. **

It would seem then that while Lela does not like being called a homophobe for calling the homosexual lifestyle immoral and wrong, he is fine labeling gay people “heterophobic” for simply stating they were “Born That Way”.

 

If discussing non-cis-het identities means cheating young people out of a “proper education” then clearly Lela’s definition of a proper education is one that makes young kids feel othered and unsafe. Gay sex is just going to be a fact of some people’s lives and refusing to teach people how to be safe about is not going to stop people from doing it. A proper education should be the one that makes sure people can feel safe both in their identity and exploring it. As someone who both identifies as queer and got what Lela would consider to be a proper education it only left me feeling more insecure and confused about myself. Education about queer identities would have helped me a lot in discovering my identity.

 


## _Non serious article:_

 

Lela claims there is no “gay gene”. Well if that’s the case, explain this picture:

_My DNA (2023, colorized)_

**Members of our group have debated many homosexuals and their supporters over the years and we are stunned at how many of them hold this hypocritical and contradictory position: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">It is okay to "discriminate" against sexual deviants like exhibitionists (e.g., people who masturbate or have sex in public) and incestuous couples, even if these deviants are consenting adults and even if they aren't hurting anybody; but it is NOT okay to "discriminate" against homosexual and bisexual deviants.</span> They try to rationalize this absurd position by saying things like "Exhibitionists offend people." We point out that tens of millions of Americans and several billion people around the world are offended by homosexual activity, such as public homosexual kissing and hand-holding.**

The difference between people being offended at exhibitionists and people being offended by homosexuals existing in public (and h*nd h*lding or kissing, activities heterosexuals do all the time) is clearly too subtle for Lela. So let me recontextualize this: I don’t understand the French language and quite frankly this offends me, people shouldn’t be speaking French in public, especially in France. However, this is not a reasonable argument for people to not be or speak French, in fact if I truly believed this you could make an argument for calling me racist. (Please don’t hate me French people). Society will never be able to appeal to everyone, some acts are always going to be offensive to some so why should we cater to homophobes getting offended at seeing relatively minor acts of homosexual affection.

 

 

The only difference between a homosexual couple kissing in public and a heterosexual couple kissing in public is that one couple has a much higher chance of sharing the same set of genitals. And if seeing a homosexual couple is making you think about their genitals I would argue the problem is you and not the couple.

 

**Can we justly discriminate in favor of some unreasonable deviations and against others? No. If we tolerate deviations from reasonable sexual standards, then we will fairly have to tolerate deviations from other reasonable standards because all of the different kinds of deviates will demand consistency from us and nondiscriminatory equal treatment.**

I don’t know why I’m bothering trying to refute someone who so easily falls down slippery slope fallacies, if I keep writing this article, I’ll end up fist fighting every homophobe I find. Because of course one cannot just say “if we allow x, then we’re just going to end up allowing y, where will we draw the line?!?!” because of course there will be a line drawn. Allowing women to vote didn’t lead to allowing lizards to vote, so why would allowing people to marry who they want lead to allowing public sex acts?

**Immoral desires obviously should _not_ be acted upon, whether they are natural or instinctual or in a way man-made. (To go to extremes to clearly illustrate a point---what if some poor guy felt a "natural/instinctual" desire to have sex with a consenting sheep---are we supposed to allow a human-animal sexual relationship? […] And what if there is a necrophilia-gene? Having sex with dead people doesn't "hurt" anyone. How ridiculous and bizarre are we supposed to allow the world to get?)**

Anyone who can claim a sheep to be consenting clearly does not understand consent. A sheep does not have the ability to consent, just as a minor does not have the ability to consent, clearly these activities are not comparable with a relationship between two consenting adults who happen to be the same gender. Necrophilia is more complex as a corpse is but an inanimate object, we ascribe special meaning to because it used to be alive. However, just as we do not extract organs from people after they die without their consent from when they were living it is reasonable to grant the dead the dignity to not be used for sex after death (I for one don’t care what happens to my body after I die, I won’t need it anymore).

 

**"Who are you to judge others?" we have actually been seriously asked by homosexuals. If we stop judging others we have to legalize murder, rape, theft, etc.---obviously ludicrous things to do.**

My attempts (although sometimes poor) to take Lela’s arguments in good faith are clearly not needed as it would seem Lela is against contextualizing arguments. Judging people for murder is clearly not on the same level as judging someone for wearing socks with sandals and yet they are both judging so why not! Why, by this argument, I can start judging people for being straight – after all, if I don’t, we might have to decriminalize murder!

 

**Hey, murder is an effective population-control measure.**

If Lela is so insistent on removing context, clearly, he is pro-murder and in fact might be coming to your house to do population-control right now!

 

**If two so-called consenting adults choose to rob a bank, we would not legalize bank-robbing.**

This metaphor is missing a crucial detail. The bank is not consenting and it is party to the situation which is what makes robbing the bank wrong. If you think there is a secret third party that isn’t consenting when two adults of the same gender choose to have sex (you) maybe consider once again that you are the problem.

 

**By the way, the more lesbians there are in the population, the fewer potential mates for straight men. No red-blooded heterosexual male should want that. And the more male homosexuals there are in the population, the fewer potential mates for straight women. No red-blooded heterosexual female should want that.**

NO BITCHES??

I fail to see the point Lela is making here. Does he really think that outlawing homosexuality will mean some hot lesbians will suddenly want to have sex with him? Does he believe that people are only gay because the law allows it and that people only stopped being straight now that it's legal to be gay?

 

**[…] the so-called "gay rights" (sad wrongs) movement […]**

I don’t really have anything to say about this other than sad wrongs is such a mood. I can’t be gay and right all the time, sometimes I’m just sad and wrong (like when doing my Ph125 problem set).
