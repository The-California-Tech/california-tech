## _The 15th F**king Person to Submit an Anonymous Article about Squirrels This Term_

Alright, let's talk about the real VIPs of Caltech – no, not the Nobel laureates, I'm talking about the squirrels. These little guys are the unsung heroes of campus comedy. Seriously, you can't walk two feet without tripping over a squirrel plotting its next big move.

First off, these squirrels have zero chill. They're not your average 'see a human and run' kind of critters. Oh no, they’re more like 'see a human and let’s hang out' type. Walk by them, and they'll look at you like you just interrupted their TED Talk on acorn dynamics.

And have you noticed how they're practically everywhere? In the trees, on the pathways, and if you're lucky, you might spot one in a lecture hall, probably understanding quantum physics better than most of us.

But here's the real kicker – make a clicking sound, and bam, you're suddenly in a Disney movie. These squirrels will chase you. It's all fun and games until you're sprinting across campus with a squirrel squad tailing you.

Let's be real, these squirrels are the unofficial mascot of Caltech. They're just as much a part of this campus as the labs and libraries. They might be a bit nutty (pun intended), but hey, aren't we all?

So next time you see one of our furry friends, give them a nod. They're just trying to make it through the day like the rest of us – with a little bit of fun and a lot of nuts.
