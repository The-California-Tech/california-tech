  These are rumors which the Board of Control (BoC) Leadership has heard from a number of Caltech community members, faculty and students. This means that some subsets of the Caltech Community believe that the other inherently operates in bad faith against the Honor Code. What does this say about the state of the Honor System?

    “Students run for the Board of Control so that they can acquit their friends of Honor Code violations.”


    “Houses set out course solutions so that everyone can get the answers.”


    “Students sit down in large groups and collaborate on exams.”


    “Professors intentionally create tests and problem sets which are impossible to finish.”

These are rumors which the Board of Control (BoC) Leadership has heard from a number of Caltech community members, faculty and students. This means that some subsets of the Caltech Community believe that the other inherently operates in bad faith against the Honor Code. What does this say about the state of the Honor System?

From the perspective of the BoC, the undergraduate student-run body which investigates allegations of undergraduate academic dishonesty, we are on a downward spiral. The Board of Control, and specifically the BoC Leadership, is drowning in work. Reports of Honor Code violations have been concerningly high since the 2015-16 academic year, but after the COVID year, reports of Honor Code violations further increased to 3 to 4 times the baseline. 

It cannot be ignored that, in some part, the undergraduate student body has failed the Caltech Community. We have failed in holding ourselves and our fellow students to a standard which has no tolerance for breaching the trust placed in us by the Caltech Community. And this has led Caltech Faculty members to reevaluate the relevance of the Honor Code – they are losing faith in the ability of the student body to fulfill their responsibilities. We do not have a right to a fully autonomous, independent, student-run Board of Control. Maintenance and protection of the Honor Code is a privilege and an honor with which the Faculty have entrusted us. But they can, at any time, choose to revoke it. Faculty feel that they have an obligation to protect the Caltech community against the devaluation of a Caltech education. They will continue to take matters of academic integrity into their own hands if there is no change on the part of the student body.

BoC Leadership wants to protect as much of a student-run process as we possibly can, but we battle against the reality that the Board of Control as it has existed for almost 100 years is not equipped for the Honor Code we live under today. The BoC was not built to process rampant cheating, not built to withstand the heavy scrutiny and ire of distrustful faculty, and not built to protect a community, faculty and students, who, whether due to disinterest, fear, or overworkedness, is in some part negligent of the implications and applications of the Honor Code philosophy. 

Pushed to the brink of failure, the Board of Control has desperately turned to the Dean's Office for further support and was forced to illuminate its proceedings and philosophies to the scrutiny of the Faculty in order to survive. Though all decision-making continues to lie in the hands of student leaders, the Faculty and Administration have now outlined requirements for the continued existence of a student-run BoC. These include implementing alternative resolution processes (such as the Early Resolution Option, or ERO) which decrease the urgency for assembling full boards for hearings. We have also developed new methods of evidence collection and dissemination to the BoC representatives and designated roles for faculty within the Board of Control process. As part of this, the administration has hired a Director of Conduct and Community Standards, Maura McDinger, who is meant to oversee the implementation of these changes in the BoC process and to investigate further areas for improvement within the BoC. McDinger now sits in on all official meetings of the Board. 

On top of these changes to the proceedings of the BoC, the BoC Leadership also senses that Faculty are considering an overhaul of the Honor System, shoring up the holes created by an incremental abandonment of trust with stricter guidelines. We’ve already seen the beginnings of these changes in our classes. Course syllabi are becoming more stringent and specific about the rights of students. More and more exams are becoming in-person and proctored. Stanford’s solution to this problem has also been suggested to the BoC by the Faculty as something that could happen at Caltech. Currently Stanford is leading an investigation into how to implement equitably proctored in-person exams. Concerningly, this investigation was somewhat strong-armed into proceeding. The Stanford Undergraduate Senate was pressured into accepting the eventual shift to in-person proctored exams under the threat of the Faculty Senate immediately allowing the implementation of proctored exams in the Fall 2023 term, according to a May 25, 2023 article on news.stanford.edu.

We have taken the first step toward sacrificing the autonomy we hold dear to protect Caltech and its students from students who have a proclivity for cheating, which is a non-negligible portion of the student body. The BoC is working to publish its case statistics on Donut, but in the last academic year, there were ~45 cases in which the respondent(s) was convicted of an Honor Code violation. Assuming that each case has only one respondent, this constitutes ~5% of the student body who were convicted of Honor Code violations during the last academic year. That’s 1 out of every 20 Caltech undergrads committing an Honor Code violation, and this statistic does not account for cases with multiple respondents. This is far too many. 

For the survival of the Honor Code and the continuation of the privileges that we currently experience under it, the BoC Leadership (currently 2 people, Heidi and Alexis) implores you to enthusiastically recommit to adhering to the Honor Code.

The BoC is not the representation of the Honor Code at Caltech, but just an official step in its implementation. We, the Caltech Community, ARE the Honor Code – every student, faculty and staff member. Take charge! The viability of the Honor Code and the continuation of its numerous benefits is in your hands.
