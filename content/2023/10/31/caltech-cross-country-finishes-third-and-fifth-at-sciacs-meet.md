The Caltech men’s team placed third in SCIACs, despite their anticipated ranking of fifth. Rohun Agrawal (ACM, ‘25) pulled out a second place performance, with an overall time of 24:53.4  and pace of 3:07/K. Joey Litvin (Math, ‘24) came closely behind in tenth place, with a time of 25:20.0 and a pace of 3:10/K. These, along with many other impressive performances from the team, ranked the men just below Claremont Mudd Scripps (CMS) and Pomona-Pitzer (PP) which have dominated the SCIAC in cross country, along with many other sports, for many years.

The women’s team also finished strong, with a fifth place overall ranking. Gigi Pistilli (Biochem, ‘26, Ricketts), Sophie Dalfonzo (BioE, ‘25, Venerable), Lauren Garriques (ME, ‘23, Venerable), and Katy Chu (CS/BEM, ‘24, Blacker) finished as the top four for Caltech and 16th, 18th, 20th, and 24th respectively in the SCIAC and all four coming in with times under 24 minutes. 

Based on their performances, Agrawal and Litvin were named First Team All-Sciac and Pistilli, Dalfonzo, and Garriques as Second Team All-Sciacs. The men’s team let out their best performance since WWII, and both teams are sending multiple runners into their post season meets, competing in the NCAA West Regionals on November 11th.
