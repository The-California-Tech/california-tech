The Caltech women’s and men’s soccer teams played their final games of the 2023 seasons this past Saturday, October 28th. Both teams played at home, honoring their seniors with their senior day ceremonies and their performances. 

The women’s team played first, at 11:00 am, against Occidental College. Caltech started the game strong, with a record setting goal by Jennifer Solgaard (EE, ‘25, Lloyd) in the tenth minute. This goal marked Solgaard claiming the Career Goals record for the Caltech women’s soccer program, a feat she accomplished by the end of her junior year, no less. Caltech was able to hold down the half, 1-0, with a series of impressive saves by first year goalkeeper Haleigh Gardner (ChemE, ‘27, Fleming). In the second half, Occidental pressed hard, their spot in the SCIAC postseason tournament dependent on their win, and came at the team with a total of twenty shots and two goals throughout the game. However, a goal by Marie Choi-Schattle (ME, ‘27, Fleming) in the 84th minute tied the game 2-2 and led to an intense last five minutes as both teams fought to break it. After a final shot by Choi-Schattle that was collected by the Occidental goalkeeper, the game ended in a tie, improving Caltech’s record within SCIACs and preventing Occidental College from competing in the tournament.

The men’s team followed in the afternoon, playing Claremont Mudd Scripps (CMS), the third place team in the conference. After being hit with a 1-4 loss earlier in the season, Caltech held the game 0-0 until the 41st minute of the first half. Although it was looking down, Caltech dominated in the second half, with 7 shots and a goal by Etienne Casanova (CS, ’26, Fleming) tying up the game in the 47th minute. This brought their record to 6-6-4, the best record the Caltech men’s soccer team has seen in program history.
