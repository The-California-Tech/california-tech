Fleming House at Caltech is known for its vibrant community and the close-knit bonds that form within its walls. Beyond the academic rigors of Caltech, Fleming provides a home away from home. The evening of Thursday, October 12th marked a significant event in Fleming House's annual calendar—Formal Dinner. This long standing tradition, known for its elegance and decorum, took an unexpected twist, leaving frosh in confusion.

In the week leading up to the dinner, a series of pranks had been meticulously planned. From belligerent behavior to surprising announcements, Fleming House was abuzz with anticipation. The freshmen, unaware of the purposeful chaos, were in for a memorable night.

As the reception began at 6:15 PM by the cannon, it was clear that this would not be an ordinary evening. President Pasco's sudden call and departure to a meeting at VPSA set the tone for the night's unpredictability. Class photos were taken, but Pat's visible frustration over the lack of waitstaff and Brendan's questionable behavior hinted at the mayhem to come.

Dinner kicked off at 6:45 PM with Sean making a memorable entrance, complete with a miniature cannon and the proclamation, "Fleming Forever." Freshmen were seated among upperclassmen to keep them on their toes. Waitstaff and librarians were tasked with enforcing etiquette while Carl feigned drunkenness and engaged in staged fights with others.	 Brendan's escalating level of intoxication and subsequent expulsion from the house added to the night's chaos. Fights erupted during dinner, with clashes between Fish and Kael and a heated argument between Kate and Dan, revolving around allegations of Dan’s unfaithfulness to Kate. The tension continued as the announcements progressed. Nicole's dramatic resignation as Soc 1, Sean's controversial, sexist comments, and a series of unexpected surprises kept the audience on edge.

However, the most significant twist of the evening came with Pasco's unexpected return. Emerging through the curtains, he asked, "Is it getting hot in here?" The room erupted in applause, and the ultimate prank was revealed: the entire dinner mess had been an elaborate joke. Participants revealed the truth about their pranks. Laughter and relief filled the room as the freshman realized they had been part of the Fleming House prank, dispelling any lingering worries about joining a house where everyone seemed to despise one another.

The night ended with an initiation ceremony for the freshmen, cementing their place in the Fleming community. They then participated in a series of fun challenges. In the end, the Formal Dinner of 2023 was a testament to the unique spirit of Fleming House where timeless traditions like these continue to bring members together.
