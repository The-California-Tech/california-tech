The Caltech Men’s Water Polo and Men’s Soccer teams saw success on Friday, October 13<sup>th</sup> and Saturday, October 14<sup>th</sup> – a strong start to the weekend for Caltech athletics.

Men’s Water Polo took two wins for the day, beginning with a 16-6 win against Fullerton College at 10:15 AM and racking up 23-5 about an hour later, at 11:30 AM, against Crafton Hills. Eight of their 11 player roster scored in the first game alone, with sophomore Bram Schork (ME ’26, Fleming) racking up a total of 24 shots and 13 goals across the two games. Scoring 12 goals in just the second game, Schork tied the Caltech goals scored per game record. Goalkeeper, Sujit Iyer (CS ’26, Fleming) also impressed with a total of 18 saves between the two games.

Men’s Soccer also scored a 4-1 win against Whittier College. Although the teams had tied 4-4 earlier in the season, Caltech dominated this match from early in the game scoring two goals in each half: two by sophomore Ishaan Mantripragada (CS ’26, Fleming), one by sophomore Etienne Casanova (CS ’26, Fleming), and one own-goal by Whittier. They allowed only one goal via a penalty kick. With the win, Caltech’s record went to 6 wins, 4 ties, and 3 losses, contributing even further to securing their best season in program history.
