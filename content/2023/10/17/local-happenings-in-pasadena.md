## Seasonal events:

Come wander in the beautiful Descanso gardens through an eery pumpkin wonderland filled with floating lanterns, a glow-in-the-dark art installation, looming hay statues, and giant hand-carved pumpkins. The Camellia Forest and Rose Garden will be decorated with festive fall spirit and lit with armies of glowing jack-o-lanterns as you wander through the trail. 

**Plein Air Art Exhibitions**

_Armory Center for the Arts_

This plein air exhibition is focused on the experience and process of being in our physical landscapes in the context of public and private space, and land surveying and settling. 

## Recurring:

**PCC Flea Market**

_November 5 and every first Sunday monthly_

_8 am - 3 pm, FREE_

_Pasadena City College parking lot_

The PCC Flea Market occurs on the first Sunday of every month. The parking lot fits over 400 vendors and mainly features antiques and collectibles. If you’re a big fan of vinyls, there are over 50 vendors selling records in the parking structure. Many students have found great finds on jewelry, clothing, skateboards, and other things you don’t think you’ll need. 

**Rose Bowl Flea Market**

_November 12 and ever second Sunday monthly_

_9 am - 3 pm, $12 regular admission_

_1001 Rose Bowl Drive, Pasadena, CA_

The legendary Rose Bowl Flea Market has been happening on the second Sunday of every month for over 50 years with over 2,500 vendors in the Rose Bowl Stadium. Some vendors accept only cash so make sure to hit up an ATM for those sweet flea finds. A word of advice: to avoid the long box office lines, you can purchase your ticket ahead of time on Eventbrite at their website. If you’re really an early riser, VIP admission is $20 which allows you to access the flea market from 5 am to 9 am, meaning you can get to those valuable finds before most of the crowd.

## One-Time:

**Watson Lecture Series: The Chemistry of Everything**

_October 18, 6 pm - 8:30 pm, FREE_

_Beckman Auditorium_

Find out where medical drugs come from! Hosea Nelson (PhD '13), Professor of Chemistry, will discuss his research group's effort to develop new platforms for molecular discovery using advanced methods in electron microscopy. The event begins at 6 pm with music and activities before talk and Q&A at 7:30 pm. 

**Pasadena Happenings**

Your favorite street is getting a rebrand! Earlier this year, the Pasadena City Council granted the Lake Avenue Pedestrian Access Improvements Project to Elecnor Belco Electric, Inc., to fund streetscape improvements on the 1.06-mile long corridor between the Lake Avenue Gold Line Station and California Boulevard. The goal of the project is to improve mobility and accessibility through the installation of two traffic signals and pedestrian scale street lighting. As of now, the current project budget sits at $3,933,090 which will include a new traffic signal at Granite Drive, curb extensions, and widening the sidewalk on Lake Ave north of Colorado Boulevard. Surveying by the City’s contractor will begin in October 2023 and is anticipated to be completed by next summer 2024.
