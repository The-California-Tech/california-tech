The 2023 ASCIT formal was a resounding success. Held at the LA Natural History Museum, their famous dioramas and dinosaur bones set the ambiance. Transportation was comparable to last year’s–not a massive surprise given the venue was directly next to last year’s venue, the California Science Center. Pictures galore were available via multiple photographers present at the venue. With a backdrop of T. rex and Triceratops fighting, every 5-year-old’s childhood fantasy, the venue was legendary. LinkedIn profiles as well as dating profiles will have been updated from the event.

The food was decent; as one student put it, it was an “up-scale open kitchen.” The live DJ was skilled and had a set comprising all the current hits.

What were your thoughts on ASCIT formal? Future venues?
