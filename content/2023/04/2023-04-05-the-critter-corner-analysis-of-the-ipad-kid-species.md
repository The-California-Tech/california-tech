The Caltech undergraduate population has, despite its small size, a  diverse variety of species that make up the techer population. This week we'll embark on an in-depth analysis of a peculiar invasive species of Techer that has emerged in the Caltech ecosystem: the iPad Kid. We will examine the case study of the _Bitchicus Matticus_ genus and species.

You may be asking, why are we examining the _B. Matticus_? The _B. Matticus_ is the most prolific subspecies of iPad Kid, amassing to what can only be refered to as a cult following. In order to call upon his followers he shouts "¡Hola Niños!" in a manner that can only be described as Dick Cheney getting kicked in the balls. The _B. Matticus_ has exhibited a prolific desire to increase its sphere of influence amongst[^1] Techers at the school. An example of this behavior has been presented by researcher Reeya Chenanda (EE '23). The artifact pictured below appears to be a covfefe mug with the face of the _B. Matticus_ which other species  refer to as "based" despite a small portion of the Techer population regaurding the mug as "cringe".

Despite its ability to amass a cult following, the _B. Matticus_ has a few flaws that have proven to be near fatal and has almost led to the extinction of the iPad Kid species as a whole. One behavior that has resulted in several close calls is the tendency the _B. Matticus_ to remain in the middle of Purple Alley watching "good" content on his phone - simular manner as one holds an iPad - leaving the _B. Matticus_ vulnerable to NERF gun assults by the predatory Lloyd frosh. The other observed fatal behavior observed is the tendency to ██████████████ ████████ ███ ███████ █████ ██████████ ██ ███████████. This will prompt the _R. Kavya_ - from which the _B. Matticus_ has form a symbiotic relationship - to further contemplate the manner to which she will hunt the _B. Matticus_ to extinction.
