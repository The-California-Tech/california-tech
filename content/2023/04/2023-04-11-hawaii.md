After a 3 year hiatus due to COVID, the Caltech Y hosted their 7-day Alternative Spring Break (ASB) trip to the Hawaiian islands. Attendees included graduate and undergraduate students alike, all with varying backgrounds, countries of origin, and courses of study - many of whom hadn’t met before the trip.

Upon arriving in Honolulu on O’ahu, we spent our first day exploring nature, marine life, and food around Waikiki and the North Shore in Manoa. Next up, we took a plane to Hilo on the Big Island where we met our North Shore Ecotour hosts, Keola and Tasha Ryan, who are both faculty at University of Hawai’i. We spent the next few days in a communal cabin surrounded by lava flow fields and the sacred volcanic peaks of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. The weather ranged from hot and humid to freezing and windy, plus random bouts of rain to keep things interesting. 

From day one, the importance of ‘Aina (land stewardship), Hawaiian language, and cultural traditions and origins were emphasized. Together, our group prepared traditional recipes like Lau Laus, during which we were taught about the cultural and spiritual importance of each ingredient. We also consistently participated in discussions with guest speakers from backgrounds including academia, conservation and resource management, and astronomy as telescope technicians. Each speaker was able to give our group personal insight about relevant issues pertaining to cultural practice and preservation, how that intersects with the pursuit of science and astronomy, and endangered species management.  \
	We were also given an amazing opportunity to learn about Polynesian navigation systems, the Thirty Meter Telescope controversies, and traditional Hula as we hiked through the stunning volcanic geology on Mauna Kea and at Volcanoes National Park.  

Sophie Polidoro (ME ‘25, Avery), one of the 12 group members, recounted that her most memorable experience was working with HuiMAU, a non-profit aiming to rehabilitate their native ecosystem. 

“Learning about how this group is trying to clear out mono-crops that were introduced to their native land and restore the plants that their ancestors used to grow there was really moving! It was nice to [contribute to and] learn from the techniques they used to restore their land, like clearing out invasive grasses and planting native edible plants to feed the community.”

The Caltech Y has many more trips and events like the 2023 ASB excursion planned and in the works! Be sure to check your emails for Caltech Y newsletters and support the Y by renting any outdoor gear you might need at a low cost.
