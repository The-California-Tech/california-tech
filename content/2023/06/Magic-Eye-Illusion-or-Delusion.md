Dear Editor,

Seeing the Magic Eye illusion (AKA autostereogram) in the May 31st issue of the Tech brought back a lot of fun memories! In my youth, my dad had a book full of these illusions, and they were a lot of fun to decipher. In fact, a framed poster of an autostereogram hangs on the wall at home! I must admit, deciphering the Tech's magic eye was a bit of a challenge since most of the strategies I use rely on a somewhat reflective surface. But after about 30(!) minutes, I was able to see it, and now it just takes me a couple of seconds to find it again. Thank you for the fun optical challenge.

I was eager to share my excitement with friends, but to my dismay, I could not find anyone else who could see the hidden image. Fortunately however, this gave me the opportunity to teach people how to see the illusion. I was eager to share the mind-blowing experience I had when I saw my first autostereogram. Over several days, I coached my friends in Dabney Hovse on how to control their eyesight, and unlock the magic eye’s secret. But my mission was ill-fated. My determination and enthusiasm that initially helped me view the magic eye became my adversaries when they became perceived as deceit. To everyone who could not see the illusion, it suddenly became easy to believe that the published image in The Tech was nothing more than a hoax. To compensate, I grew adamant of the existence of the hidden illusion, but this only strengthened suspicions. “Y’all are lying, it’s a prank, stop lying” exclaimed Kelsie Taylor (Ph ‘23, Dabney), after spending a respectable amount of time trying to see the illusion. As much as it disappoints me, I must admit her stance is justified. Let’s be real: how on Earth could any image be developed from a random field of black and white pixels? But this is exactly what makes autostereograms so remarkable! The disbelief makes finally seeing the image all the more rewarding, so Kelsie is due for a huge payoff. Other individuals have more nuanced stances on the situation. As stated by Noah Ortiz (Ma ‘23, Dabney):
