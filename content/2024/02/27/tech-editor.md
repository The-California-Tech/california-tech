### Michael Gutierrez and Lilia Arrizabalaga

**M:** Hi friends!

**L:** Howdy enemies!

**M:** This is my 15th issue as _Tech_ editor, and boy howdy, so much has happened since March 3, 2023. It’s hard to believe it’s been almost a year since I’ve had a single scrap of free time! Yes, it hasn’t been easy resurrecting the _Tech_ from its two-year shallow grave with my bare hands, but it’s been such a rewarding process. A labor of love.

**L:** As a former Dabney Hovse Athman, I know how hard it can be to get people to do stuff. This skill came in very handy when trying to coerce people into writing articles for the _Tech_ as a Managing Editor this past year.

**M:** As a current _Tech_ Editor, I know how much work it is to pull together an issue every two weeks. This skill came in very handy when procrastinating on all my other responsibilities.

**M+L:** _(in unison)** **_So that’s why we’ve decided to run together to be your co-Editors for _The California Tech_ Vol. CXXVIII! 

**L:** I'm qualified for this position because I am capable of writing at least 5 words. I know so many words; the best words; nobody else knows better words than I. Unfortunately I can’t read, but luckily my co-_Tech_ Editor can, so it should balance out.

**M:** I’m qualified for this position because I am capable of reading and writing English, I passed my frosh hums, and I’m best friends with Caltech’s Vice President of Student Affairs Kevin Gilmartin. Unfortunately I was born with my heart a few shades too light, so there’s this ever-so-slight tinge of irony or even irreverence in everything I write, which gets mistaken a lot for being unprofessional. Luckily, the degree to which you take life seriously is a gauge freedom of the universe, so it should balance out.

**L:** As proof of my commitment to both the role and the bit, I would like to demonstrate my skills by writing a brief poem about the news.

O news! 

O journalism! 

O how I long for thee,

Your tender embrace of soft paper informing me of happenings

Your pages so sterile I could deliver a baby in them

Your breaking news and your satire alike

How I mourn your loss when you are not there

When there are stories unreported

When the writers are not writing

I crave you, I desire you (carnally), I long for you

So I write this ode to thee, this sonnet (not), this love poem

In the hope that I can help you thrive

Help your pages flow with the blood of your kind (ink)

Help keep you alive

**M:** As proof of my commitment to both the role and the bit, I present to you two gifts: 1) the rest of this issue of the _Tech_, and 2) the 50% late penalty on my unfinished Ph 106b problem set. 

**M+L:** _(in unison)_ Goodbye! So long! And as always, WRITE FOR THE TECH!
