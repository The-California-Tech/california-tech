    It is a sad fact of life that in corporations, the HR department exists to protect the company from the employees.  Based on the article, it seems that the function of the Title IX office is to protect the Institute from females.

I agree that it is reasonable to expect otherwise, and to demand otherwise.  However, based on experience, I have developed cynicism, and now believe that society is litigious enough that nothing happens unless pushed for by a conscientious attorney.

Please check with the Student Defense Initiative early and often.  (I am presently unemployed or I would make a donation to them in protest of this situation as I have in the past--not often enough, I admit.)

Sincerely,

Lisa LePome
