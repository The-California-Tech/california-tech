As the beginning of February comes back around, you may notice an increase in red or dragon imagery on campus or around Pasadena; Lunar New Year is approaching on the 10th, a celebration of a new year timed by the lunar calendar instead of solar calendar. For the unfamiliar, it is one of the most culturally significant holidays in some cultures, with each year having a different representative animal based on a 12-year cycle in accordance with the lunar calendar. During Lunar New Year, people take the opportunity to gather with friends and family they haven’t seen in a while, exchange last year’s old for the new year’s good, and celebrate according to their traditions, whether that’s exchanging red envelopes or eating a homemade meal with those close to you.

Even if you don’t come from a culture where you celebrate Lunar New Year, for those curious or those who just want something to check out this weekend, there’s lots of opportunities to do so (see end). Some traditions include cleaning the house and getting haircuts prior to the new year, while others include wearing red for good luck and attending festivals. Regardless of whether or not (or how) you celebrate, the new year is an exciting time for a lot of people, and a good excuse to get a fresh start.
