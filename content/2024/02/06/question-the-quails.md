EVENTS FOR THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 6 - FEBRUARY 13!

Hey Caltech! For the first installment of the Off-Campus Events Newsletter, we’ve got a play,

Lunar New Year celebrations, one of LA’s largest food events, and a magical garden installation!

● For the aspiring playwright: Matthew Bourne’s Romeo and Juliet is starting its one month

run in LA’s Ahmanson Theater starting on January 30. The Guardian gave the play 5

stars during its London run, praising Bourne’s passionate and glittery choreography and

Prokokiev’s melancholy yet stirring score. The link to tickets can be found here:

● For the Lunar New Year celebrant: Disney California Adventure Land is hosting a

month-long Lunar New Year celebration! Enjoy treats and food carts from China, Korea,

and Vietnam. During the day, you can also see Mulan’s Lunar New Year Procession,

resplendent with a colorful dragon puppet, dancers, and costumed character across the

park. Unfortunately we don’t have a Caltech student discount for tickets to the park (yet),

but here is a generic link to get tickets:

● For the LA foodie: Smorgasburg LA runs every Sunday, where you can find dozens of

food vendors at ROW DTLA. Enjoy foods from all over the world, from Mexican cuisine

to Hawaiian barbecue (and let’s be honest, anything beats Caltech food!). The address

is: 777 S Alameda St, Los Angeles, CA 90021 - it’s about a 25 minute drive.

● For a magical group experience: Spend an evening under the lights at Astra Lumina.

Every year, these gardens are illuminated by captivating celestial-inspired light

installations. Grab a few friends and enjoy a stroll under the stars. You can get tickets

here: https://feverup.com/m/138685.
