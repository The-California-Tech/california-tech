There’s a good sandwich, nay, a great sandwich at Broad Café. Quite honestly, this sandwich is glorious. This sandwich is there to pick you up when you are down. It fills you up when you are empty. It is the Chipotle Grilled Cheese sandwich. On days when I forgot my lunch, or didn’t have time to meal prep… Maaaan, I know exactly what I’m getting on Caltech campus. It’s Broad Café’s Chipotle Grilled Cheese sandwich.

That sandwich could save lives. It’s got toasted sourdough, melted cheddar cheese, tomato slices, and chipotle aioli. It’s so good. It’s like crack. Red Door and Browne got nothin’ on Broad Café. That’s for sure.

Until July 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2024. 

I didn’t have a lunch this day. But it would be fine, right? First thing in the morning, I decided today would be a Broad Chipotle Grilled Cheese sandwich day, and it would be a great day. Or so I thought. Lunch time came and I happily jaunted from Noyes to Broad only to find red tape across the doors and a sign that said “We’re Renovating! July 22<sup>nd</sup> to Early September. Serving continental breakfast, grab & go lunch, coffee & assorted cold beverages. Ask about our daily special!”

Terror struck through my body. Why would they renovate without any warning? I was just here last week and had that glorious Chipotle Grilled Cheese sandwich, and didn’t see any signs or hear anyone talk about Broad being closed. All that remains of Broad is a sad little stand outside Broad Café with a sad little refrigerated cubby holding cold pre-made sandwiches and pre-made salads in plastic to-go containers. Not the warm, fresh-out-the-oven sandwiches placed in paper to-go boxes that feel cozy and important in your hands. I asked if they were still making the Chipotle Grilled Cheese sandwich. No.

No.

No. They were not making the Chipotle Grilled Cheese sandwich, nor the Ginger Chicken Banh Mi sandwich, nor the Broad Beef Dip sandwich.

Not until the renovations have finished.

It’s been 60 days since Broad Café has been closed for renovations. Early September has come and gone. It is (at the time I am writing this article) September 20<sup>th</sup>, 2024. I stopped by the outside stand yesterday and asked when Broad would be open again to make those sandwiches.

Three.

More.

Weeks.

She.

Said.

I don’t know how I’ll make it. I have dreams about that sandwich. I cry a little when I walk by Broad and think of that sandwich. That sandwich that I cannot have.

My labmates are sick of hearing me lament about that sandwich. Now you, dear reader, shall hear my cries.

I love that sandwich.

I miss that sandwich.

This has been the longest Caltech summer. This has been the saddest Caltech summer. I’ve been without this beloved sandwich since July 22<sup>nd</sup>.

It’s been 60 days. And now I must endure at least 21 more.

I think I’ll cry tears of joy when Broad Café reopens and I bite into that sensational sandwich. Until that day, I bid you farewell, Chipotle Grilled Cheese sandwich. All my love.
