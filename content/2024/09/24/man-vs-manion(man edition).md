**TL;DR:** Gus’s is a fantastic BBQ restaurant not far from campus.

Upon arrival, I noticed that the place was lively and a bit noisy, with tables feeling somewhat cramped. However, the service was impressively fast, with waiters frequently checking in on us. There’s free parking available in the back, but it’s worth noting that the restaurant tends to get very crowded, so making a reservation is definitely recommended.

Appetizers:

**Cast Iron Cornbread:** This dish was sweet and incredibly moist—not dry at all. It paired wonderfully with the jalapeño jelly, adding a delightful kick to each bite.

**Gus’ Hot Wings:** While these wings weren’t extremely spicy or particularly memorable, they were still decent. They complemented the ranch dressing and Kansas City BBQ sauce nicely, making them enjoyable nonetheless.

**Shredded Onion Strings:** These fine fried onions were crispy, crunchy, and packed with flavor. They paired well with ranch.

Main Courses:

**St. Louis Spare Ribs:** These ribs were a standout, super tender and practically falling off the bone. They were the highlight of the meal.

**Carolina Style Pulled Pork:** This dish was also very tender and moist, with a savory flavor that paired best with the Memphis BBQ sauce. I personally enjoy mixing in a bit of coleslaw and vinegar sauce for added flavor and texture.

**Texas Prime Beef Brisket:** Unfortunately, this brisket was a bit too dry and not as tender as I had hoped, making it less enjoyable compared to the other meats.

**BBQ Baked Beans:** Rich in flavor, these beans tasted great but were a bit drier than what I typically expect from baked beans.

**Coleslaw:** On the sweeter side, this coleslaw was quite bland and might not appeal to those who prefer a more vinegary version.

**Sweet Tea:** This was definitely not what I was expecting. It wasn’t very sweet and had a somewhat bland flavor, lacking the richness I usually enjoy in sweet tea.

Overall:

The service was amazing, and I experienced some of the best BBQ I’ve had near campus. My favorites were undoubtedly the ribs that fell right off the bone and the cornbread, which tasted amazing with the jalapeño jelly. The portions were incredibly generous—I ate so much that it started to hurt! All the in-house sauces were delicious and paired well with each meat dish. I would definitely recommend Gus's to anyone who loves BBQ and doesn’t mind a busy atmosphere.
