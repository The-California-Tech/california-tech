Caltech Campus Security and the Facilities Department have begun the process of installing outdoor cameras at all entrances to undergraduate housing. This addition expands an existing network of cameras around graduate housing, namely the Catalina apartments, and atop blue-lit emergency telephone stations.

Chief of Security Hampton Cantrell has communicated openly with the community about this process, providing information through emails with the *Tech*. Cantrell and Robert Bagley, Campus Physical Security Systems Manager, also met with the Interhouse Committee (IHC) to address questions and concerns from the undergraduate house presidents. The IHC issued a statement to the *Tech* containing a summary of that meeting.

All security cameras and their footage are subject to the “Use of Safety and Security Camera Guidelines” document, enacted in Aug. 2024 by Associate Vice President for Human Resources Julia McCallin. Students are encouraged to review these guidelines at [this link](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/5569/Use_of_Safety_and_Security_Camera_Guidelines.pdf), also accessible using the adjacent QR code:

This project is funded by a five-year grant from the California Office of Emergency Services, ending on Dec. 31, 2024. In the final year of funding, a portion was specifically earmarked for security initiatives, and the camera project was identified by the Security Office as its most effective use.

# WHY?

These cameras present a major evolution in campus security. Many of Caltech’s peer institutions already have similar camera programs, and Cantrell hopes that the cameras can help security’s response to bike thefts, a common problem in both the North and South Houses, and unauthorized entries.

While the institute lacks data on the cameras’ impact, Cantrell emphasized that “as Caltech grows with our campus security camera system, we will certainly consider how to gather useful metrics. Security is often requested for camera footage regarding thefts, personal injuries, vandalism, traffic accidents, etc.” The cameras will benefit post-incident investigations, while not replacing patrols, and serve as part of a comprehensive security strategy.

# INSTALLATION

The location of each camera is chosen by weighing maximum effectiveness against minimum intrusion. Placement is done according to a tight set of criteria, with cameras placed at entrances near card scanners to avoid capturing private yards or rooms. During the committee meeting, Cantrell and Bagley reviewed each location with the IHC to receive unanimous approval from house presidents. Special care is taken toward areas with past incidents, such as theft or sexual assault, where footage could be especially valuable.

Each camera is motion-activated, recording five seconds before and after movement, and with a controlled range of 15-20 feet subject to calibration. Infrared technology enables each camera to work at night. In full accordance with the privacy policy, there are no audio recordings. The system retains all footage on a rolling 30-day basis, rewriting recordings except when such footage has been saved for active investigations.

# CAMERA PLACEMENT

The camera plan covers entrances to the North and South Houses, including external staircases to serveries.  Two cameras shall be attached outside every house, with an additional two units targeting the external staircases of the servers. Cameras will cover the SAC area, the Olive Walk between Dabney and Fleming Houses, outside of the South House laundry room, the servery stairwell between Ricketts and Fleming Houses, Fleming House from both the Olive Walk and Orange Walk, and similarly for Ricketts House. Cameras in Dabney and Blacker Houses will view areas off Orange Walk, excluding backyards to ensure resident privacy. The North Houses will be monitored by three carefully placed cameras.

# PRIVACY

Hampton Cantrell and Robert Bagley added that if cameras are positioned in a way that one could see into the windows of student rooms, the residents would be able to put up privacy screens. This would blur all of the footage taken in the area where a screen is put up and was said to be unable to be removed after the footage is taken.

Asked whether cameras would limit student privacy, Cantrell assured otherwise. “Caltech's Use of Safety and Security Camera Guidelines require us to consider privacy as a part of the installation process. This should help reassure the Caltech community that the cameras won't view private spaces and that appropriate protocols and protections are in place to protect any footage.”

Acceptable uses of video data are to deter crime against persons and property, investigate allegations of criminal activity or policy violations, maintain and upkeep facilities, monitor sensitive areas, and comply with legal requirements. Campus Security will maintain camera inventory, review and approve camera requests, and verify that proper signage is posted where cameras have been installed. Caltech Facilities is responsible for arranging the installation and ensuring adherence to security guidelines. All said, it is worth repeating that all cameras will be outside the gates, and that they won’t be live until January.
