According to an Instagram post by @caltechsjp, Caltech students plan to hold a peaceful protest about the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict to take place Monday April 29th 10:30am–12:00pm. The protest is taking the form of a silent sit-in on the lawn of the Center for Student Services (CSS) building on Holliston Avenue.

According to the undergraduate students who organized the silent sit-in, the main goal is to "start a meaningful conversation about Caltech's affiliation with the military industrial complex and its reaching impacts in Gaza." Protesters will cover their mouths with tape "in solidarity with Palestinians being silenced." 

"This peaceful protest is for undergraduate and graduate students. I have invited a National Lawyer Guild Legal Observer to protect students' safety and legal rights," the organizers told the Tech in an email.

The sit-in was organized in response to many similar protests on other college campuses and the lack of protests at Caltech.

"I saw the protests going around multiple campuses around our nation. [It] inspired me to bring this human rights issue to the front of Caltech students' consciousness. No undergraduate had organized a demonstration so I decided to take action," the undergraduate student organizers' email continued.

The sit-in has been publicized through various social media channels including an Instagram post by Caltech Students for Justice in Palestine (@caltechsjp).

The termly "Deans and Donuts" event, planned for today at 11am also on the CSS lawn, was postponed to next Monday. This was announced in an email to undergraduates at 10:15am with no explanation.
