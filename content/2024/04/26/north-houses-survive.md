Last week, nostrils throughout Venerable House were greeted by the penetrating stench of sewage. Some feared that this was a new manifestation of "The Smell" which plagued the South Hovses for several months last year. Fortunately, the cause was localized to a single plumbing leak, which was quickly fixed by Housing staff. According to Venerable House Steward Shrishti Kulkarni, Housing expects any residual odors to fully dissipate by the end of this week.

In unrelated news, a family of skunks was discovered living near Venerable. While indeed smelly, Shrishti confirmed that they were not responsible for The Smell.
