Hello everyone! In case you haven’t heard, Professor Dana Murphy, Associate Professor of Black Studies and English at Caltech, was recently terminated. We, the students of Caltech, are writing a petition to request that the Caltech administration reinstate Professor Murphy and recognize the importance of Black studies at Caltech. We are collecting signatures and/or comments about Professor Murphy to present to these administrators. If you would like to contribute, please fill out the following Google form: https://forms.gle/LJHMwELPPxLhRESk7

Participation is voluntary, and you may remain anonymous if you prefer.

Please submit the form by Wednesday, 6/5 by the end of the day. If you have any questions or concerns, please let ChiChi Ifebi (cifebi@caltech.edu) or Sophia Steven (ssteven@caltech.edu) know.

<!-- *More details on Professor Murphy’s termination:*

Professor Murphy was hired on a contract that usually leads to tenureship. Caltech decided to end that contract on a non-mutual basis, which is usually not what happens in academia. She called it disrespectful and was overall very disappointed in Caltech when she was telling us about it.

Another professor also told me that Caltech didn’t know what her research really was until she got here. Then they fired her because her research directly targets the imperial capitalist basis that Caltech functions on.

The short answer is that Caltech doesn’t value her research in feminist black studies or her pedagogy. Another junior professor who does research in interdisciplinary studies also got terminated (Professor Rand). Usually, a professor leaving an institution is a mutual decision and this time it was not. -->
