In the heart of Pasadena, nestled between the evergreen dotted hills and the sprawling cityscape, stands a campus symbolizing human ingenuity and environmental harmony: Caltech. Remarkably, what was once a patchwork of open chaparral and agricultural land has transformed into a living laboratory where science meets sustainability. Today, Caltech’s carefully designed landscape reflects this transformation, with treelined avenues such as San Pasqual Walk as living symbols of this balance between nature and innovation. 		 	 	 		

			

The trees that line the avenues are more than mere decoration—they testify to how thoughtful planning and ecological awareness can shape the future of institutions like Caltech. The very roots of these trees remind us of our responsibility: to cultivate a future that is as resilient and deeply rooted as the land on which we stand. However, this ecological balance is delicate. In February 2017, Caltech’s iconic 400 year old Engelmann Oak, located between Dabney Hall and Parsons Gates Hall of Administration, succumbed to a fungal infection caused by the *Armillaria *oak root fungus, compounded by stress from drought and windstorms. More recently, the campus witnessed the sudden fall of another Engelmann oak near the Red Door Café in March of 2023. These events serve as poignant reminders that trees symbolize resilience and are also vulnerable to environmental stressors. This brings us to the question, why does the Earth’s delicate balance continue to be tipped by forces beyond our control, even as we understand the risks these disruptions pose to trees?

					

To preserve this fragile equilibrium, attention must be given not only to the roots but to the entire structure of the tree. According to John Onderdonk, Associate VP of Facilities Operations  and Services and Chief Sustainability Officer, the tree canopy, particularly the crown of the tree, is an incredibly important part of the long term sustainability and viability of the campus and the community. This focus on the tree canopy reflects Caltech’s broader vision of sustainability. Beyond the research labs and classrooms, the Institute’s commitment to environmental stewardship is deeply rooted in the very landscape of the campus. Its trees—over 50 indigenous and climate adaptive species— serve as a green canopy sheltering students, faculty, and staff from the merciless California sun. They are mainly symbols of Caltech’s innovative efforts to address environmental challenges. From cutting edge machine learning applications to community driven planting initiatives, Caltech’s trees are part of a broader narrative of technological advancement, ecological responsibility, and community engagement. Purposefully, Caltech has embedded sustainability into its campus culture. The necessity of aligning with nature to preserve Earth’s natural resources while ensuring the survival of humanity has never been more evident. 			

Beyond their environmental impact, Caltech’s trees influence the daily social interactions and cultural practices on campus. The green spaces, particularly the treelined avenues and shaded walkways, have become connected to the campus experience. These areas provide aesthetic value and serve as meeting points for the Caltech community, symbolizing the meeting point of nature, sustainability, and human interaction. Ethnographically, the integration of these green spaces reflects Caltech’s commitment to fostering a culture of environmental responsibility, where sustainability is not just a policy but a lived experience that shapes the behaviors and attitudes of students, faculty, and visitors alike. Maximilian Christman, Manager of Caltech’s Sustainability Programs explains that transforming Caltech’s green spaces has been a significant undertaking. Christman notes, “Of the campus’s 125 acres, 17% is covered by native/drought reistant vegetation, and 18% of the campus is covered by turf, of which 78% is of the low water use variety. 					

This represents a significant change from 15 years ago when most turf was water intensive, and indigenous vegetation only covered 4% of the campus.” Christman adds that these changes have been achieved through consistent efforts to incorporate native vegetation into all new construction projects and convert existing spaces to low water use land cover. The primary challenges, he continues, “relate to the cost of conversion and balancing the desire to preserve historical as pects of the campus.” 		

Equally important, one of the most intriguing aspects of Caltech’s efforts in urban for estry is its pioneering use of technology to understand and manage trees more efficiently. For instance in 2016, Pietro Perona, the Allen E. Puckett Professor of Electrical Engineering spearheaded a project using advanced computer vision algorithms and data from Google Earth and Google Street View to recognize tree species and record their locations auto matically. This system offered a cost effective alternative to traditional tree surveys, which were labor intensive and typically conducted only every 20 to 30 years. Consequently, this innovation has reshaped the pragmatic approach to tree conservation, demonstrating that modernism’s influence in our current postmodern era has brought us to a pivotal point in history, and Caltech is responding accordingly. 				

However, we will face increasingly challenging and vulnerable situations if we fail to address these sustainability issues. Additionally, Christman highlights that the campus boasts over 3,000 cataloged and mapped trees. He notes that Caltech’s “trees play a critical role in providing pollinator habitats, shading campus spaces, reducing local heat islands, and establishing the unique character that makes Caltech a world class institution.” 		

Similarly, Onderdonk views these comprehensive efforts as not only addressing environmental challenges, but also contributing to a broader narrative of technological advancement, ecological responsibility, and community engagement. This emphasizes the importance of Caltech’s tree canopy in mitigating the urban heat island effect and contributing to carbon sequestration.  Compared to other California institutions, this level of technological integration sets Caltech apart. While campuses such as Stanford and UC Berkeley have notable sustainability programs and robust tree inventories, they often rely on more traditional tree management and maintenance methods. Caltech’s use of artificialintelligencetoautomate tree surveys saves time and labor and provides continuous monitoring, which is particularly vital in a rapidly changing climate. This innovation aligns with Caltech’s broader sustainability goals outlined in its 2023 Annual Report, which emphasizes environmental stewardship and responsible resource management. From a utilitarian perspective, it provides the most efficient path to preserving campus biodiversity. The 2023 report highlights Caltech’s continued efforts to make its campus more sustainable. It is relevant as California’s irrigation levels in 2023 were the lowest recorded due to the state’s unusually wet winter. 				

This achievement reflects Caltech’s success in implementing sustainable landscaping practices that reduce water usage and increase reliance on drought tolerant species, such as indigenous oaks and climate adaptive trees. Consequently, this shift in water conservation is an exemplary model for institutional sustainability. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the global population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, underscoring the undeniable need for sustainable practices. As a forward thinking leader, Caltech exemplifies the principle that what sustains our existence must also be preserved. Moreover, the 2023 report highlights Caltech’s continued efforts to enhance campus sustainability, focusing on reducing water consumption and relying on drought tolerant species like native oaks and climate adaptive trees. This achievement underscores Caltech’s commitment to sustainable landscaping, setting an example for other institutions. Furthermore, Christman highlights the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in tree management, explaining that “GIS mapping for trees has become more commonplace, and Caltech uses this data to troubleshoot trees susceptible to disease, improve maintenance, protect trees during construction, and enhance campus spaces.” This technology helps optimize tree health and long term sustainability, offering a scalable model for other institutions.	Delmy Emerson, Director of Buildings and Grounds at Caltech feels integrating trees into new campus projects involves collaboration among designers, landscapers, and architects. Like Christman, she contends that the use of GIS technology and adherence to the Campus Design Principles ensure the health and sustainability of campus green spaces, while aligning with tree protection guidelines. Additionally, Emerson believes that beyond human benefits, Caltech’s trees are critical in supporting local wildlife. Indigenous species, like coast live oaks, provide shelter, food, and habitat for various animals, including birds, insects, and mammals. Their branches offer nesting sites and cover, while acorns and fruit provide sustenance. Building on Onderdonk’s insights regarding the significance of the tree canopy, Emerson emphasizes that the selection of tree species on campus is carefully guided by considerations of canopy height, spread, and root system requirements to ensure long term sustainability. These decisions not only support the preservation of local wildlife but also contribute to enhancing air quality and regulating the water cycle. This symbiotic relationship under scores the critical importance of maintaining a diverse and resilient tree canopy, which directly influences broader ecosystem health and plays an essential role in sustaining water resources, food security, and climate stability.  In addition to sustainable landscaping initiatives, Caltech faculty are engaged in cutting edge research that underscores the critical ecological functions trees serve in both environmental and atmospheric systems. For example, Dr. Jared Leadbetter, Professor of Environmental Microbiology, focuses on microbial processes and lignocellulose decomposition, revealing the pivotal role microbes play in sustaining tree health and facilitating nutrient cycling. Similarly, Dr. John Seinfeld, the Louis E. Nohl Professor of Chemical Engineering, investigates the interactions between tree ecosystems and atmospheric chemistry, with an emphasis on their capacity to mitigate pollutant levels. These research endeavors have gained heightened significance following the recent fall of the Engelmann oak near the Red Door Café, drawing attention to the importance of ongoing monitoring and management of campus tree health. Not with standing Caltech’s alignment with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Christman acknowledges that the primary focus remains carbon neutrality by 2045. He states, “Caltech finds many commonalities with the UN SDGs but isn’t currently aiming to meet every goal operationally,” noting that the institution is committed to ambitious sustainability regulations.  Looking ahead to the 2030 United Nations SDG marker, Caltech’s work aligns with global efforts to create sustainable urban environments and combat climate change. While UC Berkeley and Stanford are also advancing sustainability, Caltech’s use of artificial intelligence in urban tree management stands out. As institutions focus on meeting the SDGs, Caltech’s innovations set a standard for others to follow. As Caltech leads in science and technology, it also models environmental stewardship. The Institute’s trees stand as living symbols of its commitment to sustainability. By using advanced digital algorithms to monitor tree health, Caltech ensures its campus and community remain vibrant and green for generations. For students, faculty, and staff, the next time you walk along San Pasqual Walk or rest under a coast live oak, remember these trees are not just part of the landscape— they are integral to Caltech’s innovation, sustainability, and community engagement.
