“Blended Worlds: Experi- ments In Interplanetary Imag- ination,” an exhibit at the Brand Library & Art Center in Glendale, seeks to elucidate the universe through collaborative works by artists and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory sci- entists and engineers. The exhibit examines the dynamics of human relationships with the continuously evolving environment. Featuring a se- ries of interdisciplinary works, “Blended Worlds” challenges visitors to reflect on how deep- er connections with nature can cultivate a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about Earth and the universe. “The magic of art is that it enhances our experiences and interactions with the world— and in this case, our universe,” said Dr. Laurie Leshin, direc- tor of JPL and Bren Professor of Geochemistry and Planetary Science at Caltech. “We’re hon- ored to work with great artists to bring the wonders of space to our community through this exhibition, which invites us all to be part of a grand journey of exploration and discovery.” Artists include Ada Limón, Annette Lee, Bruce Mau, Darel Carey, David Bowen, Ek- ene Ejioma, Moon Ribas, Raffi Joe Wartanian, Saskia Wil- son-Brown, Shane Myrbeck, and Viktoria Modesta. “Blended Worlds” enables visitors to explore the uni- verse’s wonders through mul- tiple senses. “Seismic Percus- sion” by Moon Ribas interprets seismic data from Earth, the Moon, and Mars into a drum score. For the Mars data, Rishi Verma, a data systems archi- tect at JPL, collaborated with Nobuaki Fuji from the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, who was involved with NASA’s retired InSight lander. Ceri Nunn, a JPL planetary scien- tist, contributed to the moon- quake data. Another work is David Bow- en’s “tele-present wind,” which showcases grass stalks linked to tilting devices. The devices move in accordance with wind data from Mars gathered by NASA’s Perseverance rover mission. Verma and José An- tonio Rodríguez-Manfredi, the principal investigator of the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) system on Perseverance, contributed to making the installation.				

“We were looking to create imaginative opportunities for people to connect with each other as they connect with the awe-inspiring science being conducted today,” said David Delgado, a cultural strategist at JPL. “I know this experience has really opened the eyes of everyone collaborating on the project, and we hope it does the same for people who come to see ‘Blended Worlds.’” 	The exhibit is part of “PST ART: Art & Science Collide.” Organized by the Getty Foun- dation, PST ART consists of exhibitions, public programs, and other resources that ex- plore the intersections between art and science. The Southern California event aims to foster dialogue on current pressing is- sues, including climate change, environmental justice, and the future of artificial intelligence. “Blended Worlds” is one of three PST ART projects led by Caltech. As a campus extension of the exhibit, “Earth Data: The Musi- cal,” an original production by Theater Arts at Caltech, aims to portray the experiences of climate scientists, highlight- ing both the challenges and rewards of their essential re- search. The musical takes place in Caltech’s Ramo Auditorium from November 1 to 3.“Blended Worlds” is on view until January 4.
