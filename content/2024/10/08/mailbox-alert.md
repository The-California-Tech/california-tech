It has come to our attention that there is wrong information going around about Mailbox assignments. Here are the rules:

1. Mailboxes are assigned at check -in and you keep them while you are an **active** student
2. If you withdraw for whatever reason the box is pulled and re-assigned. **It is not held.**
3. Any correspondence/packages that come in with your old MSC is returned.
4. Mailboxes should be checked daily

Any questions contact either Alice Edel – Tech Express [aedel@caltech.edu](mailto:aedel@caltech.edu)
