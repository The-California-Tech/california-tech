Do you dream of shaping the future of space exploration, working alongside leaders in the field, and engaging directly with NASA, astronauts, and industry pioneers? The Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) at Caltech offers an incredible opportunity for graduate students and postdocs through its renowned KISS Affiliates program—an experience that promises to elevate your research, expand your professional network, and immerse you in the discussions that shape space missions.

**What is KISS?**

If you’re like me when I arrived at Caltech, you’ve wondered what’s behind those KISS logos floating around campus, suggesting mysterious events closed off to the general public. Founded in 2008 as a joint initiative between Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), KISS operates as both a think tank and a practical research hub, where big ideas about space exploration are born and tested. With a mission to advance space mission concepts and technology, KISS has made its mark on the future of space by fostering collaboration between Caltech researchers, JPL, and international experts. Past projects led to the development of  NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission and  helped to build the science case for the  InSight Mars Lander.

**The KISS Affiliates Program**

But KISS isn’t just about established researchers - it’s also about you. The KISS Affiliates program invites Caltech graduate students and postdocs who are seen as the next generation of space exploration leaders. Nominated by faculty, KISS Affiliates gain access to some of the most exciting aspects of the space industry: you’ll interact with industry CEOs, astronauts, mission leaders, and NASA officials who are shaping the future of space exploration. Not only will you attend monthly events (with a free meal included!), but you’ll also become part of an elite cohort where you can network, collaborate, and share your passion for space.

One of the best parts? Affiliates say that their time with KISS was one of their most rewarding experiences at Caltech - both personally and professionally.

**How to Get Involved** If you’re a graduate student or postdoc passionate about space exploration, now is the time to act! The 2025 KISS Affiliates nomination process is open, with nominations due by **October 31, 2024**. While the program typically selects one graduate student and one postdoc from the Engineering and Applied Science (EAS), Geological and Planetary Sciences (GPS), and Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy (PMA) divisions, space-related candidates from other divisions are also encouraged to apply.

**What Are We Looking For?** We're seeking candidates who are not only passionate about space but who also contribute to the diversity of perspectives within the cohort. Do you bring a fresh perspective or a groundbreaking idea to the field of space exploration? This is your chance to shine. Faculty nominations are required, so start the conversation with your advisor today.

**Nomination Details:**

- Name of Candidate
- Position (Graduate Student or Postdoctoral Scholar)
- Advisor’s Name
- Division (EAS, GPS, PMA, or other space-related fields)
- Why should this candidate be considered for the cohort?
- How does this candidate contribute to the diversity of the group?
- Any potential connections to JPL?

**Why Join KISS?** The benefits of becoming a KISS Affiliate extend far beyond academic credentials. You’ll gain unique insight into how space missions come to life, meet the trailblazers who make it all happen, and have the chance to contribute to high-impact, cutting-edge space research. You’ll leave the program not only with connections and knowledge but also with the sense that you’re truly a part of something bigger - something that informs and inspires your views on what’s possible in space exploration.

So, if you're ready to take your passion for space exploration to the next level, talk to your advisor about a nomination. The universe is waiting!
