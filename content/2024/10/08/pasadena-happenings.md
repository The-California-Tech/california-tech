Recurring Events:

**PCC Flea Market**

*November 3 and every first Sunday monthly*

*8 am - 3 pm, FREE*

*Pasadena City College parking lot*

The PCC Flea Market occurs on the first Sunday of every month. The parking lots along S. Hill Avenue host over 400 vendors and mainly features antiques and collectibles. If you’re a big fan of vinyls, there are many vendors selling records inside the parking structure levels. Many students have found great finds on plants, jewelry, clothing, skateboards, and other knick-knacks.

**Rose Bowl Flea Market**

*November 12 and ever second Sunday monthly*

*9 am - 3 pm, $12 regular admission*

*1001 Rose Bowl Drive, Pasadena, CA*

The legendary Rose Bowl Flea Market has been happening on the second Sunday of every month for over 50 years with over 2,500 vendors in the Rose Bowl Stadium. Some vendors accept only cash so make sure to hit up an ATM for those sweet flea finds. A word of advice: to avoid the long box office lines, you can purchase your ticket ahead of time on Eventbrite at their website. If you’re really an early riser, VIP admission is $20 which allows you to access the flea market from 5 am to 9 am, meaning you can get to those valuable finds before most of the crowd.
