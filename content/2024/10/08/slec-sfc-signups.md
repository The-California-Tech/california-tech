Sign-ups for undergraduate students to participate in the 2025 Student Faculty Conference (SFC) and Student Life and Experience Conference (SLEC) are now open. The ASCIT Board of Directors has been working to secure the support of faculty and administrative staff for the chance for students to finally be able to take the initiative to make a visible difference within the Caltech experience. This will be accomplished by creating consensus between students, faculty and administrators. In order to create this consensus, all committees will avoid litigated past grievances and look forward to making objective, data based recommendations that consist of actions to be taken.

As stated in the last issue, the SFC will focus on issues related to Caltech’s curriculum, course structures, and academic policies. Through this conference, students will have the opportunity to present their ideas and collaborate with faculty to shape the future of academic programs at Caltech. This collaborative platform has been essential in maintaining Caltech’s academic rigor while ensuring alignment with student needs. The SFC will consist of the following committees:

- Special Topic Committees - Prerequisites and How Core Prepares Students For Option Coursework and State of the Honor Code.
- Option Committees - Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) and Information and Data Sciences (IDS), Astrophysics (Ay), Bioengineering (BE), Biology (Bi), Business, Economics, and Management (BEM) and Economics (Ec), Chemical Engineering (ChE), Chemistry (Ch), Computation and Neural Systems (CNS), Computer Science (CS), Electrical Engineering (EE), Geological & Planetary Science (GPS), Materials Science (MS) & Applied Physics (APh), Mathematics (Ma), Mechanical Engineering (ME), and Physics (Ph).

Likewise, SLEC will include students, faculty, and administrative staff to address topics relevant to student life while ensuring a holistic approach to enhancing the undergraduate student experience. The SLEC will consist of the following committees:

- Special Topic Committees - Extracurriculars and Campus Relations.
- Standing Committees - First Year Experience, Clubs, Events, Admissions, Food, Athletics & Recreation, Diversity & Inclusion, Equity & Accessibility, Health & Wellness, and Experiential Learning & Professional Development.
