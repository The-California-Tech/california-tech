Last Saturday at 11:22am, Regular Decision acceptance letters went out to Caltech’s Class of 2028. 

Quick facts:


* Caltech received approximately 13,000 total applications for Class of 2028, comparable to Class of 2027’s 13,136 applications.
* This is the fourth undergraduate class since Caltech stopped accepting SAT/ACT scores.
* This is the second year since Caltech switched to Restrictive Early Action (REA).
* The total number of students accepted into the Class of 2028 has not been announced yet, but according to the Admissions Office, it is less than last year. (412 students were accepted into the Class of 2027 last year.)
* This is the least number of students admitted into a Caltech class in the past 30+ years (the _Tech_ only has data beginning 1993 – see page 2 for details)
* 25 Questbridge students were admitted through the National College Match. (Compared to 35 in the Class of 2027.)
* The target class size is 230, according to the decision letters sent by Chief Admissions Officer Ashley Pallie. They expect less than that number to commit to Caltech by May 1st, and plan to fill the remainder of spots from the waitlist.
* Discover Caltech (“DiscoTech”), formerly known as Prefrosh Weekend, will take place April 17-19. As previously reported in the _Tech_, the Admissions Office plans to invite roughly 200 prefrosh to campus for the event. All DiscoTech hosts, including roommates, will be compensated with $20 in Amazon credit per prefrosh hosted.
* The graduating Class of 2024 had an initial size of 225. If the target of 230 students is reached for Class of 2028, the size of the student body will not significantly change.
