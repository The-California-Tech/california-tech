We’re not _just _a STEM school! \
On Valentine’s Day (February 14th for our unfamiliar Techers), the Caltech Arts Guild hosted it’s debut event Wine* and Cheese canvas painting and origami night hosted in the Blacker Hovse dining hall. With over 70 attendees over the course of the evening including grad students and undergrads alike, at least 10 pounds of cheese in addition to other consumables were vanquished.

After the successful night, the club has since gathered more funding to continue to host an additional 2 art night events on campus. 

Keep an eye out for the announcements next term!
