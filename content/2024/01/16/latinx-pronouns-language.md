# “Latinx”: Pronouns, language, and gender.

_Lilia Arrizabalaga | Managing Editor | Editorial_

 

You have probably heard the term _latinx_. You may have even used it before. And if you’re a friend of mine, you’ve probably heard me complain about it. Designed as a more inclusive and gender-neutral alternative to _latino/latina_, many members of the community it sets out to describe (myself included) have problems with it.

 

To start with, the term _latin/o/a/x_ is a pan-ethnic term which groups people of many nationalities and identities under one label. While this can be useful for grouping data or creating community spaces, many people prefer to identify with a more specific label, such as one describing their nationality. Indeed, even grouping all people from Latin countries together for data collection purposes can have problems. There can be a wide variance in data even among the Latin American countries.

 

In addition, I would argue that the use of the word is unnecessary in many cases. Due to the way gendered words work in Spanish, _latinos_ can refer to either a group of men or of mixed gender while _latinas_ refers to a group of only women. This means that referring to a group of mixed gender, including trans or non-binary people with _latinos_ is not grammatically incorrect. There are people who still find this objectionable, but I would argue that using the word _latinx_ instead is just much worse.

 

Lastly, my main problem with the word is that it is not pronounceable in Spanish. Even when I’m thinking in my head, I can notice myself pronouncing _latino/a_ with a noticeable Spanish accent and _latinx_ in a very American accent. There is just no smooth way to pronounce the x at the end of the word and even pronouncing it “latin-equis” is distracting and jarring in an otherwise natural Spanish sentence. If the goal of this word was to make gender diverse and non-binary people feel more included, I don’t think this is accomplished by making the word distinctly “othering” and unpronounceable.

 

In short, using “x” as a gender-neutral ending in a language in which this is not a pronounceable way to end a word is just stupid. It is predominantly used by non-Latin Americans, and it is even seen by some to be “linguistic imperialism”. This might be slightly misleading, as the term was coined by queer Latin people, but it remains that only 3 percent of Latino adults have heard of and use _latinx_ (according to a 2020 Pew study). While I assume most people who use _latinx_ mean well, the trend strikes me as people overcompensating in order to be “woke” while ignoring the realities of the situation, or, in short, virtue signaling.

 

Now don’t think I would write a whole article complaining about this without offering a solution: _latine_. _Latine_ is much more common in Latin America, but its use has been spreading to the United States. _Latine_ succeeds where _latinx_ fails in my mind. The “e” suffix is pronounceable and consistent with the convention of the “o/a” suffix on other gendered terms. In addition, it does not sound out of place when used in other words. Some people have even begun to use _elle_ as a gender-neutral pronoun (instead of _ella_ which is feminine or _él_ which is masculine).

 

Of course, I do not speak for every Latin person. If you’re ever in doubt as to how to refer to someone, just ask. But personally, as a non-binary person of Latin descent, I think _latine_ is a step in the right direction. And hey, having the option to use a gender-neutral pronoun is great, even if learning a new word is a bit scary.
