# Pick This Up…

_Yakov Shalunov | Opinion_

…and once you’re done reading it, put it somewhere it belongs or throw it away. As long as I’ve been on campus, one thing has been prominent outside of Red Door. The COVID tents have come and gone, the windows have broken and then been repaired, but one thing has not changed: the litter. Inside Red Door and outside it alike, receipts and napkins are scattered across the floor, empty food packaging lays on the ground next to the trash cans, and, now, copies of the Tech are left indiscriminately on surfaces by irresponsible readers.

It’s an embarrassment—you made it into Caltech, surely you have the capacity to _do better_—and, perhaps more importantly, it just looks ugly. It’s not only rude to the CDS staff – it’s an Honor Code violation. A minor one, but a violation nonetheless. So next time you’re eating, do CDS and all your fellow students a favor and _pick up your fucking trash_. And when you’re done reading, don’t just leave this on a random table. Take it with you, throw it out, or put it back wherever you got it.

Do better.
