  In the previous November 28, 2023 issue of the Tech, the article titled “Vice President of Student Affairs Addresses Controversy Over Discontinuing Rotation Events” incorrectly stated that undergraduate women were first admitted to Caltech in 1960. The correct year is 1970. In fact, Caltech first hired a woman (Professor Emeritus Jenijoy La Belle) as part of the tenure track faculty in 1969, who subsequently had to fight for ten years to obtain tenure.

In the previous November 28, 2023 issue of the Tech, the article titled “Vice President of Student Affairs Addresses Controversy Over Discontinuing Rotation Events” incorrectly stated that undergraduate women were first admitted to Caltech in 1960. The correct year is 1970. In fact, Caltech first hired a woman (Professor Emeritus Jenijoy La Belle) as part of the tenure track faculty in 1969, who subsequently had to fight for ten years to obtain tenure.

Additionally, admitting undergraduate women was not a change "forced on students whether they like it or not," as stated in the article. Rather, it came about as a result of very strong student advocacy as well as support from the faculty and administration in 1967 and a special push by Caltech president Harold Brown in 1970, despite opposition by some alumni. Thanks to Richard Wright (BS ‘68, Fleming) for this info.

In the article titled “Caltech Unionization Effort” published October 31st of last year it was claimed that ¾ survey respondents had personally witnessed or experienced some form of bullying or discrimination. The survey (N=251) actually found that “more than 46% of grad students and postdocs who responded reported experiencing or witnessing bullying behavior, sexual harassment, or discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, race, disability, or immigration status.” See also: Jessica Goodheart’s January 3rd article in The American Prospect magazine.
