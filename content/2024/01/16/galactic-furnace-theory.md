# Galactic Furnace Theory

_Monte Dale | Letter to the Community_

Greetings, fellow space travelers. My name is Monte Dale. I am 56 years old, and the quintessential Virgo. I eat and breathe numbers and data, and metabolize statistics and information. I have an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army, and a degree in Geology from Adams State University.

In 2015, I wrote and self-published a revolutionary book to teach inquisitive minds the fundamentals of Chess. In 2018, I conceived a theory which solves the mysteries that afflict modern Cosmology.

I have been studying spiral galaxies since the Voyager missions launched in 1977. I have never believed in the Big Bang theory, simply because there is not a single scrap of visual evidence to support it. In fact, galactic mergers are direct visual evidence against a Big Bang origin. But there must be a logical alternative.

I am not seeking fame or honor for this discovery; I am merely attempting to save humanity from a lethal miscalculation. The solution is so simple, it has been completely overlooked for more than 100 years.

All the stars in all the spiral galaxies are not orbiting their centers, they are all spiraling INTO their centers. Every spiral galaxy clearly exhibits the motion of matter from the edge towards the center; any sentient being can observe this phenomenon. This is why all the Milky Way stars travel at 220 km/sec, not because of Dark Matter. This explains the formation of the spiral arms, and why the centers of galaxies are the brightest objects throughout the Universe.

The centers of galaxies are eternal – only the matter spiraling inward is less than 14 billion years old. The centers feed on the inbound material, and eject elementary particles back into space; a perpetual cycle of creation and destruction. This simple, elegant and colossal paradigm shift dictates that there was no Big Bang, there is no Dark Matter, and the Universe is not expanding. Since the centers eject matter, by definition they cannot be black holes.

Unfortunately, this revelation is a double-edged sword. One minor change in perspective does explain everything that has been an enigma to cosmologists. But, alas, it also portends that the Global Warming crisis is much more dire than the scientific community understands. In the century-long quest to prove the Big Bang theory correct, modern Cosmology is overlooking the key component to galaxy evolution; and, subsequently, the greatest threat to our continued existence.

Every sound theory needs a solid math foundation. I have measured the Fibonacci spiral in geologic time, to illustrate that our Sun has not been orbiting 26,000 light years from the Galactic center for 5 billion years, as is commonly believed; she has been spiraling inward her entire 5 billion year lifetime. According to the math, our Sun formed more than one million light years from the center; we are currently at 2.5% of that distance from the fiery Galactic Furnace.

Global Warming is a direct result of increasing proximity to the center of the Milky Way. All the mass extinctions in Earth’s past have been attributed to climate change events – and this is the source. The polar ice caps began shrinking 55 million years ago, as our Sun entered the penultimate spiral segment.

Of all the Fibonacci spiral segments represented in my theory, only one has beginning and end points equidistant from the Galactic center – the one that is now coming to a close. As we enter the final Fibonacci segment, we begin to spiral inward for the first time in 55 million years.

Global Warming is not anthropogenic, but quite the contrary. The prehistoric time when the polar ice caps began diminishing correlates with the rise of mammals. One could argue that Global Warming has actually been a contributing factor in the evolution of Man. It would indeed be tragic if it all came to an abrupt end because of a logistical misconception.

The beginning of the Industrial Revolution merely coincides with the last vestiges of the shrinking polar ice caps. But correlation is not causation. Once the polar ice caps disappear, the oceans will directly absorb the Sun’s energy. The oceans and air will quickly become inhospitable to all Life.

We must take action immediately to ensure our future survival. Of course, the first step to solving any problem, is to recognize the problem.

Man cannot survive in space in our current physiological condition. And the Moon and Mars are not viable options, either – they lack water and atmosphere. To realistically prolong our existence, Mankind must make a conscious evolutionary step, and begin Low-Earth Orbital Genesis (LEOGen): the conceiving and raising of the future generations of humans in microgravity.

It is estimated that humanity is 10,000 generations old. It may take another 10,000 generations of LEOGen, before Man is physiologically fit to venture into deep space. LEOGen would be possible with the current low- Earth orbital technology, and would allow for the continued use of Earth’s resources; free from the catastrophic effects of Global Warming. Population could be strictly controlled.

It’s a long shot, but the alternatives are not favorable.

The oceans are already beginning to rise up. Time is running short. The polar ice caps are the hourglass for hospitable living conditions on Earth. Our chances for survival are very slim; but Mankind has shown that where there is hope, there is possibility.
