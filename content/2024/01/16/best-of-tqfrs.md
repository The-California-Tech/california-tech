# Best of: TQFRs

Teaching quality feedback reports, or TQFRs provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences, either positive or negative, about classes they have taken. In this new column we will look at some of the most entertaining.

**FA 2023-24 — Ae/CE 221**

**Space Structures**

Dear Ae221, what say to you?

Nobody once told me, this course was gonna roll me,

Not the sharpest gore in the balloon volume.

She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of a dihedral angle on her forehead.

Well the tears start coming and they don't stop coming.

I saw the Beckman dodecahedron fountain, traumatized, I hit the ground falling

Didn't make sense, this inextensional equilibrium nonsense,

Most undergrads dropped and PFd the class, the rest of us were dumb.

So much to prove, so much to read

So what's wrong with my truncated octahedral prism?

You'll never know if you don't fold

You'll never pass if you don't code.

Hey now, you're a sucker, get your space frame, go deploy

Hey now, you're a MechE, get your inner angles, space fill.

And all that we make are folds,

Only grad students break the mold

Space is a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're self-stressed now, wait 'til you get older

But inextensional mechanisms beg to differ

Judging by the miura-ori satellite picture

The origami paper is getting pretty thin

The Matlab computers getting warm so you might as well take a Twinkle Tea break

My world's on fire, how about yours?

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

**FA 2023-24 — Ma 001A**

**Calculus of One and Several Variables and Linear Algebra**

the vibes - im going to tear my hair out if i hear the word 'partition' again AHAHHHAHHHHHHHHHHH oh my god... this class is doable but it feels like your mind is getting hammered over and over and over and over and over like I've never felt so dumb while doing homework. but it is really satisfying when you finally figure out a nice proof.

Thermal Science**

The professor is good, but wastes way too much time complaining to his students about cheating. I understand this was a large issue last year, and I fully support the prof. doing what is possible to prevent it. I even get scaring students into not cheating. That being said, this point could have been made about 1/8 as frequently and still have been effective. Every day the good students were told they were cheaters, it sucks as a student. The prof. should BOC the cheaters and move on with his day.
