    As your friendly neighborhood former Dabney Athman, I have a great passion for trying to get people to go to the gym. As part of these efforts, I would like to give you a nice example workout.

As your friendly neighborhood former Dabney Athman, I have a great passion for trying to get people to go to the gym. As part of these efforts, I would like to give you a nice example workout.

**Dumbbell Bicep Curls with Static Hold**

\- This exercise will help give you the strength to hold a newspaper for the prolonged time it will take you to read it

**Farmers Carries**

\- A classic exercise that will prepare you for hauling 200 newspapers through a cold Boston morning to deliver *The Tech*

**Push Ups**

\- My number one exercise, pop a copy of *The Tech* in front of you while you do them to remind you of proper form keeping your head in line with your spine.

**Burpees**

\- This one has nothing to do with *The Tech* I just like making people suffer

**Warm Up:**

- Arm circles 10 seconds each direction
- 1min jumping jacks
- 30s arm swings
- Circuit (do each exercise, rest then repeat x4):
    - 10 Dumbbell Bicep Curls with Static Hold
    - 10 Push Ups
    - 30s Farmers Carries
    - 10 Burpees

**Cool Down:**

- Do some static stretches to cool down, then grab a copy of The Tech and read through it for good measure.
