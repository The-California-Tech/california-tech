At 06:30, a student in Dabney House saw security with flashlights taking lots of pictures and moving around things in Dabney Backyard, primarily on the ground by the greenhouse.

At 07:19, security pulled the fire alarm in the South Houses and told people in person to go to either Avery dining hall or Bechtel (varying by person).

At 08:04, an email from Caltech Notification System said:

> Caltech Security is still responding to an alleged bomb threat on the south side of campus, near the south undergraduate houses. Pasadena Police are on-site and have identified a suspicious package in the area.\
> Out of an abundance of caution, undergraduate residents in Blacker, Dabney, Fleming, and Ricketts houses have been evacuated. They have been relocated to Bechtel Residence and Avery House. Please remain clear of the area around the south undergraduate houses. Individuals who are not already on campus, should stay away. California Boulevard is closed to road traffic between Arden and Hill.\
> This is an active and developing situation. Updates will follow.
