At 07:53, the Olive Walk was blocked off with security tape. Red Door Cafe and Browne Dining Hall stopped service and were also evacuated. The North Houses were not being evacuated.

At 06:53, security began searching the trash cans inside Fleming and Dabney House, and blocked off the exits to the Orange Walk.

At 06:30, a student in Dabney House saw security with flashlights taking lots of pictures and moving around things in Dabney Backyard, primarily on the ground by the greenhouse.

At approximately 05:00, Pasadena Police approached a group of students working on a radar project for an electrical engineering class outside on South Holliston Ave. The students explained and demonstrated their project, and the police moved on.
