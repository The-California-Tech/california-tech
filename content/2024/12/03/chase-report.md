The Committee on House Assessment, Support, and Experience (CHASE) was formed in Spring 2023 and “charged by the Vice President for Student Affairs Kevin Gilmartin to develop strategic recommendations to ensure that the undergraduate houses remain supportive living and learning environments, where current and future Caltech students can thrive and succeed,” according to an email sent to undergraduates last spring. The Committee was composed of current students, faculty, staff, and alumni. As part of their investigations, focus groups and a survey of the student body were conducted.

The main deliverable of CHASE is a final report, which will contain recommendations for Student Affairs policies and residential life matters. It was originally estimated to be released in late October or early November of 2024. A draft of the report and its findings have been presented to the Board of Trustees and VPSA Gilmartin, but as of December 2 at 5pm, the final report is still under review and has not been published.

The recommendations in the CHASE Report will be vital to the preservation and evolution of undergraduate House culture. The report itself is complete — the work is done — now we’re just waiting on bureaucracy.

The *Tech* will publish a full analysis of the report once it is ready.
