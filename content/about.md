*The California Tech* aims to publish biweekly except during vacation and examination periods by the Associated 
Students of the California Institute of 
Technology, Inc. The opinions expressed 
herein are strictly those of the authors and 
advertisers. Letters and submissions are 
welcome; e-mail submissions to tech@caltech.edu as plain-text attachments, including the author’s name, by Thursday 
of the week before publication. If you would like to write for the *Tech*, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Zaah8749s2) -- it is the editorial team's main method of communication. the *Tech* 
does accept anonymous contributions 
under special circumstances. The editors 
reserve the right to edit and abridge all 
submissions for any reason. All written 
work remains property of its author. The 
[advertising](/advertising) deadline is 12 pm on Friday; 
all advertising should be submitted electronically or as camera ready art, but the *Tech* can also do simple typesetting and 
arrangement. All advertising inquiries 
should be directed to the business manager at tech@caltech.edu

# Journalistic Principles
## The News-Opinion divide
All articles shall be clearly and explicitly labeled as either News or Opinion/Editorial.

News articles report on topics that have been thoroughly researched by *Tech* staff writers, and should be impartial to any one point of view. In a News article, the writer shall not insert their own personal feelings on the matter; the purpose is to let the facts speak for themselves. The *Tech* assumes full responsibility for all content published as News.

In contrast, Opinion articles (including Letters to the Editor) may be written and submitted by anyone on any topic; while the *Tech* will edit all published Opinions to ensure no wrong or misleading information, we do not otherwise interfere. Again, the role of the *Tech* here is to help the whole campus communicate their ideas and share their stories, not promote specific ones. Content published as Opinions do not necessarily represent the values of the *Tech* or our staff.

An exception to this is Editorials, which are written by *Tech* staff and represent official opinions of the *Tech*. Any information and sources in Editorials shall be held to the same standard as News reports, but there is no promise or expectation of impartial coverage.

## Fair Reporting
All facts of major significance and relevance to an article shall be sought out and included.

If an assertion is made by a source about a specific person or organization, they shall be contacted and given a reasonable amount of time to respond before publication. In other words, no second-hand information or hearsay shall stand on its own.

## Quotes and Attribution of Information
Facts and quotes that were not collected directly by *Tech* reporters shall be attributed. Articles shall clearly differentiate between what a reporter saw and heard first-hand vs. what a reporter obtained from other sources.

Sources’ opinions are just that — opinions. Expert opinions are certainly given more weight, as are witness opinions. But whenever possible, the *Tech* shall report facts, or at least corroborate the opinions. A reporter’s observations at a scene are considered facts for the purposes of a story.

## Sources
All sources shall be treated with respect and integrity. When speaking with sources, we shall identify ourselves as *Tech* reporters and clarify why we would like to hold an interview. Sources for the *Tech* will never be surprised to see their name published.

In published content, we shall put our sources’ quotes into context, and — as appropriate — clarify what question was being answered.

We always ask that a source speak with us on the record for the sake of journalistic integrity. We want our audience to receive information that is credible and useful to them. Named sources are more trustworthy than unnamed sources because, by definition, unnamed sources will not publicly stand by their statements.
That being said, we realize that some sources are unwilling to reveal their identities publicly when it could jeopardize their safety or livelihood. Even in those cases, it is essential that the *Tech* Editor-in-Chief knows the identity of the source in question. Otherwise, there can be no certainty about whether the source and their quotes were falsified.

This also applies for Letters to the Editor and Opinion submissions to the *Tech*. If the author requests that their piece is published anonymously, they must provide a reason, and we shall consider it in appropriate circumstances. No truly anonymous submissions shall be published. Conversely, no submissions shall be published with the author’s name without their consent.

When we choose not to identify a source by their full name, the article shall explain to readers why.

## Corrections Policy
We strive for promptness in correcting all errors in all published content. We shall tell readers, as clearly and quickly as possible, what was wrong and what is correct.
Corrections to articles will be immediately updated on the online version of the *Tech* at [tech.caltech.edu](https://tech.caltech.edu). If appropriate, corrections will also be published in the following *Tech* print issue.

## The Honor Code Applies
In any remaining absence of clarity, the [Honor Code](https://www.deans.caltech.edu/HonorCode) is the guiding principle.
