*The Tech* is a student-run newspaper at The California Institute of Technology.

We publish every other Friday during the school year (not published during vacation and examination periods). We typically run four pages of news and four of commentary.

It is our policy to pay* all photographers, news writers and assigned opinion writers and three free academic credits are available per term for those who put in at least three hours per week.

Editors distribute articles and photo tasks by individual assignment; the absolute deadline for each issue is 5:00 p.m. on the Wednesday before publication.

Newcomers are welcome -- we need more writers! Feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YSDv9dQra5).

The opinions expressed herein are strictly those of the authors.
